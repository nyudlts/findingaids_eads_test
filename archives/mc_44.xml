      <p>Materials are largely in their original order.  Most folders are arranged chronologically. Within the folders the material is arranged chronologically in descending order. Some arrangement was imposed by archivists when original order was not known, or materials had been separated from the rest of the collection, as in Series VI through VIII.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged in eight series:  
Series I: Subject, Historical Reference, and Personal Files</p>
      <p>Series II: Research, Committees, Talks, Reviews, Still's Articles</p>
      <p>Series III: NYC Research</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>From 1947 to 1987, Dr. Bayrd Still served New York University (NYU) as historian, archivist, teacher, and administrator. An authority on urban history and urban development, Dr. Still's interests and commitments extended beyond his academic research and the university to involve landmark preservation in New York City. </p>
      <p>Bayrd Still was born on July 7, 1906, in Woodstock, Illinois. He received bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in history from the University of Wisconsin. Before assuming his professorship at NYU, Still taught at Ohio Wesleyan University, the University of Wisconsin, and Duke University. </p>
      <p>From 1947 to 1974 Dr. Still was a professor at NYU in the Department of History, for which he also served as chair from 1955-1970. In 1955 Still was appointed head of the undergraduate history department at University College as well as head of the graduate program of history. In 1957 he became head of the all-university Department of History and remained so until 1970. Additionally, he served as acting dean for both the undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Arts and Science from 1958-1959, and again from 1959 to 1960. Throughout his teaching career, Still taught at both the University Heights campus and the Washington Square campus. </p>
      <p>President James M. Hester established the Office of the Archivist in 1967, appointing Thomas C. Pollock as University Archivist, and Bayrd Still as Chair of the Advisory Committee on the History of New York University. The committee helped to write the NYU history. When Pollock resigned in 1969, Still declined the position of University Archivist, continuing instead as chair of the Advisory Committee. He played a key role in the founding of the University Archives project until 1975, when he became University Archivist. </p>
      <p>Still was an authority on United States urban development and westward expansion.  Courses he taught included "The History of the American City since 1820" and "The History of New York City."  His publications include: <emph render="italic">Urban America: A History with Documents</emph>, <emph render="italic">Milwaukee, The History of a City</emph>, <emph render="italic">Mirror for Gotham: New York as Seen by Contemporaries from Dutch Days to the Present</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The West: Contemporary Records of America's Expansion Across the Continent, 1609-1890</emph>. </p>
      <p>In 1961 Still served as supervisor for New York University graduate fellowships with the New York Community Trust. In 1962 Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed Still to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, a position he held until 1965. Still also served on the Mayor's Task Force on Municipal Archives in New York. In 1975 he became the Chairman of the Advisory Board for the Brooklyn Rediscovery Project. He was a member of the New-York Historical Society, the American Studies Association, and the Society of American Historians. In the 1980s Still organized and conducted walking tours of NYU and Greenwich Village. Dr. Still died in Woodstock, Illinois, on November 19, 1992. </p>

      <p>The Bayrd Still Papers have undergone additional processing since they were opened to researchers.  Added description reflects original file categories and titles that Still used in his inventory.</p>
      <p>The Bayrd Still Papers and the Landmarks Collection were originally two discrete collections before they were merged in 2001.  Materials from the Landmarks Collection are now in Series VI.  </p>
      <p>Series VII was added to the collection in 2011, and Series VIII in 2016.  Boxes 64 and 65 were rehoused in manuscript boxes and integrated into the Bayrd Still Papers in May 2016.</p>
      <p>Personal notebooks found in the repository were added to Series I as Subseries D: Personal notebooks in December 2018.</p>
      <p>In 2019 materials were rehoused by Preservation and sent to offsite storage.</p>
