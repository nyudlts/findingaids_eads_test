    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Stephen John Brademas, Jr. (1927-2016) was born in Mishawaka, Indiana to Beatrice Goble Brademas, a schoolteacher, and Stephen John Brademas, Sr., a Greek-immigrant restaurateur. Brademas graduated from South Bend Central High School and entered the University of Notre Dame in 1945, but soon left to join the Navy where he was appointed to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps until May 1946. In September of that year, he entered Harvard College and in 1949 graduated with a B.A. in Government. From 1950 to 1953, he studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, England, where he received a Doctor of Philosophy in Social Studies.
<lb/>
<lb/>
From 1959 to 1980, Brademas represented the Third District of Indiana in the United States House of Representatives. He served on the Education and Labor Committee, the House Administration Committee, and the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress. Brademas played a principal role in writing major legislation concerning all forms of education, including elementary, collegiate, and vocational training. He was also a major proponent of legislation for services for the elderly and handicapped, as well as Federal support for cultural institutions and the arts. In January 1973, Brademas was appointed Chief Deputy Majority Whip and in 1977 was appointed Majority Whip, a position he held for the next four years.
<lb/>
<lb/>
After leaving public office, Brademas accepted the position of President of New York University (NYU), serving from 1981 to 1992. During his tenure, he worked to change NYU from a primarily commuter school by facilitating the construction or purchase of 11 residence halls, which by the time he left, housed 44 percent of the NYU student population. Under his guidance, NYU also added new academic programs including the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies and the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. During his tenure, Brademas established NYU programs in Cyprus, Egypt, France, Israel and Japan. In July of 1990, he announced his resignation and officially stepped down from his position, becoming president emeritus in 1992 after a sabbatical. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
After leaving NYU, Brademas served as chairman of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities from 1994 to 2001. From 2004 to 2007, he was a member of the New York State Board of Regents. In 2005, NYU established the John Brademas Center of New York University, a research and teaching facility. He was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees and awards, many conferred by European governments or cultural organizations. Brademas passed away in 2016.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Decisions regarding arrangement interventions for this collection prior to 2018 are not yet recorded. During this same time, sections of the material were refoldered and an inventory was created. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
In 2019 memorabilia was rehoused by Preservation and sent to offsite storage. During the processing of this collection, the remaining material was foldered and previously  overstuffed folders were separated and refoldered. Original titles were transcribed onto the new folders when possible. All material was placed in appropriately sized containers. Audiovisual material was removed and boxed separately. Previously untitled and undated files were provided more description and dates, while any new file titles were added to the end of the inventory within each series.
<lb/>
<lb/>
File titles were reviewed by the processing archivist and when identified as restricted, were physically separated, notated in the file title (e.g., "Correspondence RESTRICTED"), physically separated, and stored in shared restricted boxes.
<lb/>
<lb/>
One carton of audiovisual material, four cartons of paper, and 22 boxes of personnel files were removed and deaccessioned from the collection. Twenty-five containers of material were separated from this collection and transferred to other NYU special collections.

Folder titles in the Development Series were not published in the finding aid due to personal information.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection contains records of New York University's 13th President John Brademas who served from 1981 to 1991. Files created by Brademas' office contain material related to the responsibilities of this position, including public appearances and events; contact with various NYU Schools and Divisions staff; interaction with student groups and representatives; and fostering NYU's relationships with various governmental departments and other organizations as they relate to funding and/or educational policy for universities. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
Files in this collection include Brademas' speeches and remarks; NYU Board meeting material; and public relations event planning files which include video recordings related to NYU's acquisition of the La Pietra villa. Additionally, this collection contains internal and external communications, reports, and meeting notes related to NYU facilities, NYU Schools and Divisions, and student groups. Files accumulated by Brademas on individuals, organizations, and companies document his relationships cultivated for the purpose of fundraising, educational policy support, and NYU program development. Although a selection of Brademas' chronological correspondence has its own series, a significant amount of topical correspondence can be found throughout the entire collection. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
Pre-1981 office files in this collection were likely a carry-over from the previous President's office and used for reference by Brademas and his staff. Material dated beyond Brademas' term found in this collection covers projects he continued for NYU working as president emeritus, after officially leaving office in 1991.</p>  </scopecontent>

Information on NYU's overseas programs; the Urban Studies and Research Center; the Grey Art Gallery; and the Japanese Business Center are in this series. The "JB Project" files appear to be ideas fostered by Brademas, including a Chinese University Presidents' group visit to NYU and a potential Latin American Foreign Ministers Conference. Brademas' travel briefing books in this series were created for his trips taken between 1989 to 1990 to Greece, Cyprus, and France. These briefing books typically contain schedules, support material for meetings, and profiles on people he would meet during the trip. Similar travel briefing material can also be found in Series VII.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref15" level="file"><did><unittitle>Academic Matters</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1981/2001" type="inclusive">1981, 2001, undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Files in this series contain requests for Brademas appearances and speeches; planning files for NYU events; and correspondence. A small collection of speeches in this series date from 1981 to 1984; however, a more comprehensive set can be found in Series XIII. Planning files for events hosted in Brademas' penthouse residence are in this series and typically include invitation lists, menus, and schedules. Clippings and press releases in this series feature Brademas and his connection to NYU. Photographic portraits of Brademas, as well as event photographs are in this series. Event photographs include parties at the Onassis Center in Greece, and Brademas' trips to Asia. A large number of video recordings in this series contain footage for a possible informational video for NYU's Villa La Pietra in Florence, Italy. These videos contain interviews with Sir Harold Acton, views of the building and grounds, and historical stock footage.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1542" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, Memos, Clippings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1980/1982" type="inclusive">1980-1982</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

The speeches (1981 to 1991) are from events including NYU graduations, Board of Trustee and Senate University meetings, and other public appearances. Speech files often contain final copy and drafts; notes; and informational memos containing event location, time/date, and background. Three of these speech files also include video recordings. Unless otherwise stated, the speeches were delivered by Brademas. Yearly NYU graduation ceremony files often contain detailed schedules, event programs, and speeches from all presenters. This series also contains op-ed pieces, articles, and memos written by Brademas. Presidential greetings and letters for use by various NYU publications are also in this series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f08c040a66c2fd72e7c53eefca33bd97" level="file"><did><unittitle>Budget Cut Discussion, Congressional Breakfast (Washington, D.C.)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1981-04-08/1981-04-08" type="inclusive">1981-04-08</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
