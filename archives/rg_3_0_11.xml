    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Born in Walden, New York, on September 23, 1933, L. Jay Oliva (1933-2014) received his B.A. from Manhattan College in 1955, and his M.A. (1957) and Ph.D. (1960) from Syracuse University. He began his career at New York University (NYU) in 1960, as a night school history lecturer, becoming a full professor of history in 1969. Around this time, he began to take on administrative responsibilities in addition to his academic duties. From 1970 to 1975, he served as Deputy Vice Chancellor, and from 1971-1972, as Dean of Faculty for the University College of Arts and Science. He then became Vice President for Academic Planning and Services (1975-1977), Vice President for Academic Affairs (1977-1980), Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs (1980-1983), Chancellor and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs (1983-1990), and finally, President (1991-2002). In addition, Oliva was the co-founder of the George H. Heyman, Jr. Center for Philanthropy and Fundraising and he served as executive producer and chair of the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts. </p><p>In 1990, the NYU Board of Trustees unanimously elected Oliva as the successor to John Brademas and NYU's 14th president. On November 21, 1991, Oliva became the first faculty member in the institution's 163-year history to be elevated to this position. Oliva's presidential tenure was marked by a major fundraising drive, started by John Brademas, and completed by Oliva five years early. He also completed a second $1 billion campaign in five years. Oliva also focused on transforming NYU from a commuter school into a global university by hiring well-known professors and offering more foreign-study programs. Applications tripled during his tenure. As president, Oliva continued to teach Russian history and served on various boards and committees, including the Institute of International Education (IIE), the University Athletic Association (UAA), and the League of World Universities, for which he was the main organizer. Prior to becoming the president of NYU, Oliva published two books, <emph render='italic'>Misalliance: A Study of French Policy in Russia During the Seven Years' War</emph> (1964) and <emph render='italic'>Russia in the Era of Peter the Great</emph> (1969); and various articles, including many related to sports, such as "How to Clean Up College Sports (<emph render='italic'>The Washington Post</emph>, November 20, 1986), and others related to university-issues, such as "The Dorming of New York City" (<emph render='italic'>The New York Times</emph>, January 28, 1989), among others. Oliva was the recipient of numerous awards, such as the Ellis Island Medal of Honor (1992) and a National Italian American Foundation honor (1994), and honorary degrees from Tel Aviv University and Hebrew Union College, among others.</p><p>Oliva passed away in 2014.</p><p>Sources cited:</p><p>Martin, Douglas.

<p>Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2019 are unknown.</p><p>At the time of processing, the collection was arranged and described into series and subseries based on the original order and the types of materials. Financial materials (payroll, invoices, and expenses), duplicate publications and documents (including those on floppy disks), publications available online, and documents with sensitive personal information were removed. Twenty floppy disks were forensically imaged and analyzed. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content. Eight boxes from RG 6.0.8 were incorporated into this collection because the dates of the materials corresponded with those of Oliva's presidency.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Records of the Office of the President (Oliva), 1960-2007, include the day-to-day operations and pursuits of the President's office under L. Jay Oliva's tenure. The collection consists of materials created and collected by Oliva before, during, and after his presidential tenure, encompassing his long career at NYU and exhibiting how his viewpoints were shaped over time. Materials include correspondence, speeches and writing, reports, meeting minutes, and publications from various departments and schools. There are fundraising materials (grant applications and reports, donor briefings, and budgets) which demonstrate Oliva's focus on campaigns and appeals during his term. Additionally, there are memos to departmental heads and committees; announcements and press releases; event materials (invitations, programs, and agendas); travel itineraries; reports to various stakeholders; and correspondence and related materials with other organizations (outside of NYU) on which Oliva served as a board member or committee participant. Many of these items, such as the event programs, speeches, and publicity materials, exhibit Oliva's goal of transforming NYU into a global university since they include the dedication of new or enhanced programs abroad (such as NYU in London and the various events at Villa La Pietra). The collection also includes memorabilia (commencement robe, plaques, and pins), artwork, and photographs.</p>  </scopecontent>

As president of the university, Oliva was a member of most of these governing bodies. The majority of the files consist of Board of Trustees materials, such as agendas, meeting minutes, memos, and member files; additionally, there are board materials for individual schools (such as the Medical School and School of Law), committee files, and University Senate files, all of which include agendas, meeting meetings, and memos. The University Senate files also contain the annual "State of the University" addresses.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_5d5a2f3830b33adb63358c70ec9c5d8e"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_337a832e4c263a498e3f23608b893d20" level="file"><did><unittitle>Administrative Management Council</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1991/1994" type="inclusive">1991-1994</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
