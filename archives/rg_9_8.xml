    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Institute of African American Affairs (IAAA) at New York University, which was initially called Institute of Afro-American Affairs, was founded in 1969 to research, document, and celebrate the cultural and intellectual production of Africa and its diaspora in the Atlantic world and beyond. The New York University Senate created the IAAA to coordinate the university-wide academic and service activities focusing on cultural programs for NYU's Black students, faculty, staff, and larger New York community. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
The IAAA is affiliated and shares leadership, staff, and facilities with NYU's African Studies Program. Both organizations are committed to the study of Blacks in modernity through concentrations in Pan-Africanism and Black Urban Studies. The Institute also founded the first statewide organization of scholars in the field (The New York State Black Studies Conference) and played a pivotal role in the creation of the NYU Association of Black Faculty and Administrators. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
Along with many programs, panels, and conferences, the IAAA also each year hosts Artists and Scholars-in-Residence, who during their residencies participate in seminars, offer public presentations of their work, and meet with students. Past Artists-in-Residence have included author Walter Mosley; poet and essayist Amiri Baraka; actor, playwright, and performance artist Anna Deavere Smith; poet Jayne Cortez; actor and producer Danny Glover; and Malian musician Salif Keita. Scholars-in-Residence have included Nigerian author and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka; and David Levering Lewis, MacArthur Fellow and Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of History at Rutgers.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2018 are not yet recorded.
<lb/>
<lb/>
In 2020, unprocessed paper material was rehoused in new acid-free folders and boxes, kept in their original order, and inventoried at the folder level. Unprocessed audiovisual material was labeled with unique numbers, grouped by format, placed in appropriately sized boxes, and inventoried to the item level in chronological order. In the finding aid, the unprocessed material file titles were added onto the end of existing inventories for some series, while new series and subseries were also created for new material. Select creator-supplied titles containing racist and ableist language were identified in this collection, but have been retained to convey important contextual information regarding time and place in which the documents and titles were created. Additional processing notes were added at the series and subseries level where these titles are listed.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Previously processed paper material was refoldered and reboxed when necessary, and all file-level barcode notes were removed from the inventory. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. Data CDs, DVDs, and floppy computer disks were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. Sixty digital objects were created and added into the collection inventory to repressent the over 5,000 computer files.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Series-level dates, extents, and scope and content notes were added to the finding aid.
<lb/>
Further accretions have been rehoused in archival boxes and folders and added as discrete series, with a folder-level inventory.
<lb/>
In 2022, a retrospective accession was created for the archived website and the website was added to the resource record as a series.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Records of the Institute of African American Affairs (IAAA) date from 1963 to the early 2000s with a large portion of the collection consisting of material related to the planning and promotion of IAAA conferences and events, in the form of paper files, computer files,  and audiovisual recordings. Events with a significant amount of material in the collection include the Black Male Conference; Black Theater Forum; the Artists and Scholars-in-Residence program; Black Genius; the Yari Yari conference for Black women writers; and the Slave Routes: The Long Memory Symposium. A small amount of work files for the IAAA publication <emph render="italic">Black Renaissance Noire</emph> are in this collection, dating from 1992 to 2004.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Files created by IAAA Founding Director Roscoe C. Brown Jr., Acting Director Edward M. Carroll, Earl S. Davis,  and Manthia Diawara date from the 1960s to the early 2000s. These files typically contain meeting minutes, correspondence, and research related to the IAAA. Internship program files dating from the 1970s to the 1990s in this collection relate to the Association of Education in Journalism, which was co-founded by Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr.
<lb/>
<lb/>
The collection also contains 266 recordings of <emph render="italic">The Soul of Reason</emph>, a radio talk show that aired between 1971 and 1986, with interviewees which included politicians, professional athletes, medical professionals, and contemporary artists. Audio recordings of another radio talk show, <emph render="italic">The Urban League Presents</emph> can also be found in this collection. These recordings date from 1963 to 1973 and cover a wide range of topics impacting the Black American community.  Audio recordings in this collection from May 1965 highlight an NYU Teach-In which had been organized as a protest against the Vietnam War. Founding IAAA Director Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. was a speaker at the event.</p>  </scopecontent>

Brown Jr. (served from 1969 to 1977), Acting Director Edward M. Carroll (served from 1977 to 1979), Earl S. Davis (served 1979 to 1994) and Manthia Diawara (1992-2018).  Files include advisory group minutes; IAAA Director and staff correspondence; conference packets and notes; IAAA histories and annual reports; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Program material; and Black Scholars Lecture Series speaker information. Articles and scholarly journals found in files throughout this series that pre-date the IAAA were likely accumulated for subject or research files by the Directors.

This series also contains project files from 1979 to 1987 related to multiple scholarly monographs published by IAAA. The original monograph was produced by a group of Black scholars to commemorate IAAA's 10th anniversary in 1979. After its successful release, additional monographs were published in later years.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1634" level="file"><did><unittitle>ABFA</unittitle><unitid>cuid16420</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/1990">1990</unitdate><container id="aspace_c7eb503a7142d3ef944960095b5de129" label="Mixed Materials [31142042260318]" type="Box">14</container><container parent="aspace_c7eb503a7142d3ef944960095b5de129" type="Folder">32</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1637" level="file"><did><unittitle>ABFA -- Confidential For Adm.

The host of the program, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. was also the Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs (IAAA) at NYU at the time. The show's mission was to be "a showcase for Black scholarship….to examine the foundations of African-American thought from a variety of areas," according to founding documents for the show. During each episode, Brown conducted an informal, back and forth dialogue with a variety of professionals, mainly from the New York City area, who spoke personally to the unique challenges of the Black experience. These shows initially aired at 10pm and 12am on WNBC and rebroadcast a few weeks later on WNYU.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_cf31cc91a875dcf9c06d1487e4931de4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This sub-series contains 266 audio recordings of <emph render="italic">The Soul of Reason</emph> radio show for episodes which aired between 1971 and 1978.
