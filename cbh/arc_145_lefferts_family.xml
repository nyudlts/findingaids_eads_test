    <abstract id="aspace_4807f13bec3f68d4eb6210794cae1f31">The Lefferts family papers contain documents created and collected by members of the Lefferts family, a Brooklyn family of Dutch origin that played a prominent role in the city's politics, society, and development. The collection also contains records created and collected by the stewards of the Lefferts Historic House Museum in relation to the Lefferts family and the house's history. The documents span from the 1650s to the 1970s and include those created by members of the Lefferts family in Brooklyn (particularly in the town of Flatbush) as well as members of the family that branched out into other parts of America including Ohio and Illinois. The collection covers a variety of subjects including the development of Flatbush, the Lefferts family role in the political, economic, religious, and social life of Flatbush and Brooklyn, colonial life, slavery, and more. The documents include personal papers and correspondence of the family members, papers related to maintenance of their farm and businesses, genealogical records of the family, and photographs and other graphic materials of family members and the Lefferts house. The collection also contains related clippings, some maps, and an assortment of books either owned by or related to the Lefferts family and Flatbush. There are some documents related to the maintenance of the Lefferts Historic House and some documents and graphic materials collected over time by the stewards of the house.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The first member of what would become the Lefferts family to arrive at what would become Brooklyn was Pieter Janse Hagewout, a cobbler who sailed in 1660 from Holland to New Amsterdam on the ship de Bonte Koe (The Spotted Cow). In 1661 Hagewout bought a house and lot in Vlacke Bos (Flatbush), but it is unknown what became of this land. It was his eldest son, Leffert Pieterse, who would go on in 1687 to purchase the fifty-eight acres in the village of Flatbush upon which the original Lefferts homestead would be built. From Leffert Pieterse on, the Lefferts family extended their land holdings in Brooklyn, Long Island, Queens, and New Jersey as well as extending the size of the Lefferts homestead in Flatbush. Leffert Pieterse's great-grandson, Peter Lefferts (1753-1829) married Femmetie Hegeman in 1784 and through the marriage and a purchase of 100 acres of land from Femmetie's sisters he acquired parts of the neighboring land once owned by Evert Hegeman. </p><p>Acquiring so much land and being one of the first Dutch families to develop in Brooklyn placed the Leffertses in a prominent position in the political and civic life of Flatbush and other parts of Brooklyn, and many Lefferts family members assumed roles typical of this prominence. Peter Lefferts (1753-1791) was a first lieutenant in the American Continental Army during the revolution and went on to hold such positions as Flatbush's Overseer of Highways and Overseer of the Poor. He was also elected as one of two delegates from Kings County to the Constitutional Convention in Poughkeepsie, NY in July of 1788 and was one of the founders of Erasmus Hall. Like many other members of the family would be in the future, Peter was involved with the Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church, serving as one of its first trustees and eventually as Church Master. Peter Lefferts's son, John Lefferts (1785-1829), was the County Treasurer (1811-1813), elected to Congress (1813), and elected to the State Senate (1826). Other prominent Lefferts family members include: Jacobus Lefferts (1757-1799), one of the wealthiest farmers and land holders in New Utrecht; Leffert Lefferts (1774-1847), first judge of King's County in 1823 and owner of a large farm in the village of Bedford Corners; John Lefferts (1826-1893), farmer and eventual President of the Brooklyn Safety Deposit Company, director in the Long Island Loan and Trust Company and stock holder in the Brighton Beach Railroad. Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt was another important member of the family, not only through her marriage to Judge John Vanderbilt (b. 1829) but also through her chronicling of Lefferts family history and genealogy and the social history of Flatbush.</p><p>The Lefferts house itself is an example of colonial-era Georgian architecture with two-stories, a gambrel roof, an attic, and a basement. In 1776 the Lefferts house was burned down by American troops, an action taken on several Flatbush homes so that they could not be used by the invading British and Hessian soldiers preceding and during the Battle of Long Island. Peter Lefferts (1753-1791) rebuilt the house on the same spot and, according to Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt, used some of the original timber and pieces from the original house with few modifications to the original design. Ownership of the house passed down through the family until the estate of John Lefferts offered the House to the City of New York on the condition that the House be moved from its original location (the site of the former boundary line of the town of Flatbush) onto city property. The City agreed and in 1918, in conjunction with the Dutch House Preservation Committee, the house was moved to Prospect Park. In 1920 the house was first opened as museum under the stewardship of the Fort Greene chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The Lefferts Historic House is now owned by the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation, operated by the Prospect Park Alliance, and is a member of the Historic House Trust. The house has undergone several renovations and is maintained as a historic house museum.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Lefferts family papers contain the records created and collected by members of the Lefferts family as well as some records created and collected by the Lefferts Historic House. This includes documents of the Lefferts farm, Lefferts land acquisitions and indentures, business transactions, genealogical records, photographs and other graphic materials, news clippings, books, personal papers, and ephemera.</p><p>The contents of the collection span from the 1650s to the 1970s though the bulk of the collection span from the 1720s to the 1930s. Much of the earlier material includes the land deeds and other estate matters of the family and shed light on the family's growing economic and political importance over time. This growing economic and political role includes the growing farm and land holdings, involvement in the development of Brooklyn's transportation infrastructure, and important positions among Brooklyn's banks, legislative system, and judicial system. Many prominent members of the Lefferts family are represented by these documents which were either created by them or reference them. Some of these family members are John Lefferts (1719-1776), Peter Lefferts (1753-1791), Femmetie Hegeman Lefferts (1760-1847), Jacobus L. Lefferts, Leffert Lefferts (1774-1847), Maria Lott Lefferts (1786-1865), and Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt (b.1824). The papers also include some records of individuals and families related to the Lefferts family such as John Cortelyou (1772-1829), the Lott family, the Remsen family, and the Alexander family. The case of John Cortelyou is particularly interesting as he was declared "A Lunatic" and had his estate handled by John Lefferts. The papers of Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt include manuscript notes on her family's experience in the 1863 Draft Riots and on her family in general. The Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt documents give a greater sense of the social history of the family and of Flatbush. The majority of the other papers on these Lefferts family members are in reference to their business matters and include inventories, promissory notes, land indentures, account ledgers, and some correspondence. Other Lefferts business is accounted for in the <emph render="bold">Lefferts Businesses</emph> series which includes Incorporations which the Lefferts were involved in (primarily transportation infrastructure companies) and some general receipts and business items in regards to the Lefferts farm.</p><p>The collection contains many items related to slavery including property lists, wills, and financial transactions that included enslaved people, bills of sale for enslaved people, slavery related news clippings (primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries), and financial records of payments to possibly free black men for manual labor. Among the draft manuscripts of Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt are accounts of the New York Draft Riots of 1863 and accounts of slavery among the Dutch in early New York. The collection also has some Civil War materials including a collection of clippings with accounts of battles and political issues and some clippings in regards to the assassination of President Lincoln.</p><p>Genealogical materials on the Lefferts family are also well represented in the collection. The collection contains copies of Teunis G. Bergen's <emph render="italic">Genealogy of the Lefferts family, 1650-1718</emph> and Lefferd M.A. Haughwout's <emph render="italic">The Lefferts-Houghwout family: a chart genealogy in eight generations</emph> (these monographs can also be found in the Brooklyn Historical Society stacks). The collection also contains several hand-written pages of Lefferts, Hegeman, Haughwout, Cortelyou and Lott family births, deaths, and marriages. Many of these genealogical records came from the Lefferts family bibles and some of these bibles still contain pages with genealogical or other notations written on their flyleaves. Many of the family bibles are in Dutch and are interesting artifacts of the religious connection of the Dutch families in Flatbush. This is further illustrated through the other religious books (also primarily in Dutch) that have been preserved within this collection. Other personal books of the Lefferts family within the collection shed light on Lefferts life as artifacts, such as the various cookbooks, one of which is entirely hand-written and probably belonged to Maria Lott Lefferts and Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt.</p><p>The collection contains images of various Lefferts family members, though many of the figures in these images are unidentified; these images are in a variety of formats including photographic prints, glass plate negatives, daguerreotypes, and tintypes. In addition to the photographs the collection contains a handful of maps. Most of these maps appear to be related to surveyor assessments and the sale of Lefferts-owned property. Other graphics include images of Brooklyn, New York City, and representations of the Battle of Long Island which resulted in the burning of the Lefferts homestead. More information on the Lefferts homestead can be found within the clippings files. The articles are primarily retrospectives concerning the place of the Lefferts family and their home in Brooklyn history, particularly as an old Dutch family which rose to prominence. There are also some articles concerning the house's eventual move from Flatbush to Prospect Park. More images of the house and other Lefferts buildings are among the graphic materials, showing the state of the house and Brooklyn at different periods. The collection also contains a handful of items in relation to the maintenance of the Lefferts house as a historic house and some ephemeral items that were among the materials within the house.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The collection is comprised of four separate accessions. The provenance for accession 1977.347 (the account book of Jacobus Lefferts) and the provenance for accession 1977.445 (receipt for shares in Brooklyn, Jamaica and Flatbush Turnpike company for Leffert Lefferts) are unknown, but both were formally accessioned in 1977. Accession 2006.004 (Lefferts family papers and memorabilia) was given as a gift in January of 2001 by Carol Schleede Chester. Accession 2010.001 (Lefferts family papers and book) was given as a gift in January of 2010 by the Prospect Park Alliance and Lefferts Historic House Museum of Brooklyn, NY.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The Lefferts family papers come from four different accessions. Two of these accessions, 1977.347 and 1977.445, were single items and were simply integrated with the rest of the Lefferts materials. Accession 2006.004 was previously processed by an archivist at Brooklyn Historical Society in conjunction with the Lefferts Historical House Museum staff in 2006. The project was supervised chiefly by Leilani Dawson. This accession was reprocessed when it was combined with the two earlier, single-item accessions and the most recent accession, all containing relevant Lefferts materials.  </p><p>The most recent accession, 2010.001, consists of materials from the Lefferts Historical House Museum of the Prospect Park Alliance. These materials consist of items that have been part of the Lefferts Historical House since it was first moved to Prospect Park in 1919 and materials that were collected by or donated to the museum up until 2010. The museum was originally under the stewardship of the Fort Greene chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and some of the collected items reflect their interests in American colonial history. Other items were donated by descendents of the Lefferts family. No previous processing or arrangement was done on the materials from this accession.</p><p>Only accession 2006.004 had a discernable arrangement and after the addition of the three other accessions, the current arrangement somewhat reflects that prior arrangement, including separate series for Lefferts books and Lefferts visual materials, but with some notable additional series such as <emph render="bold">Genealogical Material</emph> and <emph render="bold">Maps</emph>.</p><p>These materials were collectively processed by Craig P. Savino in 2011.</p><p>Oppressive descriptive language was remediated from the subject terms, abstract, and scope and contents notes in this finding aid as part of an anti-racist descriptive language audit performed in December 2020. Folder titles were retained to maintain record of descriptive language of collection creators.</p>  </processinfo>

These related families include the Cortelyou, Vanderbilt, Lott, Smith, Nostrand, Ditmars, Vecht and Remsen families of Brooklyn. Many of the prominent Lefferts family members are included in this series. Date spans of the lives of each figure have been provided where possible so as not to confuse the figures with other family members with the same name.</p><p>These documents include some of the early land grants and indentures maintained by the Lefferts family. Among these are the original land grant from Peter Stuyvesant to Pieter Janse Hagewout in 1661 and the records of his great-grandson, Peter Lefferts. Among Peter's files is an account of items and expenses for his funeral. Among the papers of his wife, Femmetie Hegeman, is the deed and land grant from Peter Stuyvesant to Adriaen Hegeman. Part of this land eventually passed to Femmetie and would become part of the Lefferts farm after her marriage to Peter. The papers of Peter's father, John Lefferts (1719-1776), includes an inventory of his estate taken in 1778 and provides an account of items the Lefferts had closest to the burning down of the Lefferts home in 1776. The files on Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt include accounts of her experiences on the family farm during the 1863 Draft Riots including aiding and sheltering black Americans who had fled from Manhattan. These files also include a manuscript titled "Incidents in the home life during the War of the Revolution" containing recollections of the family's oral history in regards to the Battle of Long Island. A folder on John Cortelyou (1772-1855) includes many documents on his care after he was declared "A Lunatic". John Lefferts was appointed to oversee Cortelyou's estate.</p><p>The series also includes some business and legal records related to the Lefferts family and other historic Brooklyn families. This includes some slave bills and indentures, land transfers, estate claims by members of the Ditmars and Vechte families, and the title for the Remsen family farm.

The majority of the materials in this series concern transportation infrastructure companies that operated in Brooklyn such as the Jamaica and Flatbush Turnpike Company, the Gravesend and Coney Island Bridge and Road Company and the Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railway Company. Many of these companies were involved in creating the early transportation infrastructure of Kings County some of which is still used today.

The "General Small Items" and "Manuscripts and Poems" are all items which were between the pages of Lefferts books or mixed in with other Lefferts documents without credit to their source. This series also holds some items connected to the Lefferts outside of the Lefferts Historic House Museum. The brochure on "Brookwood" refers to once Virginia home of Mary Gray Lefferts and the report from the Lefferts Manor Association refers to association of the landmarked area within the Prospect-Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn. This series also includes some hand-written recipes used by Cornelia Stuyvesant.

Many of the images are reproductions of etchings which themselves reproduce earlier artwork. Many of the recreated views of Brooklyn, including views of Fulton Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, Atlantic Avenue and the Old Stone House at Gowanus, depict scenes from the early to mid 19th Century. Many of the New York city scenes depicted include the New York waterways, such as "The Narrows from Staten Island", "The Ferry at Brooklyn", the view of New York from Staten Island and the view of New York from Weehawken, NJ.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref130_z31" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Abbey" (Fulton Avenue near Hudson Avenue, 1835)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1850/1879" type="inclusive">circa 1850s-1870s</unitdate><container altrender="Large Flat Box" id="aspace_10c8810631d817bb5a3d28c683599eb7" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">OS 7</container><container id="aspace_243dbae78d4eb9d4e139e0a3921cc6de" parent="aspace_10c8810631d817bb5a3d28c683599eb7" type="item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref131_ugf" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Brooklyn in 1853"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1850/1869" type="inclusive">circa 1850s-1860s</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_02b06766a537c603dd07548ea613f0fa" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">5</container><container id="aspace_ff45b7f79d21738e768226304f70a744" parent="aspace_02b06766a537c603dd07548ea613f0fa" type="Folder">22</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref212_rom" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Brooklyn in Winter" (Francis Guy)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1800/1820" type="inclusive">circa 1800s</unitdate><container id="aspace_d015b000d94957f8563c8f0a05e61928" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">Mold 2</container><container id="aspace_6184663dde310c966168e09d124106ea" parent="aspace_d015b000d94957f8563c8f0a05e61928" type="item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref137_w4k" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brooklyn, View of (1840)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1865/1865" type="inclusive">1865</unitdate><container altrender="Large Flat Box" id="aspace_1810a7c290e68aa0a17d991d75fd0b4f" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">OS 7</container><container id="aspace_165fd25d59bcae7d83942eed363fc0c4" parent="aspace_1810a7c290e68aa0a17d991d75fd0b4f" type="item">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref132_904" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Ferry at Brooklyn"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1839/1839" type="inclusive">1839</unitdate><container altrender="Large Flat Box" id="aspace_a2bb4e033da293407312b249883f75aa" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">OS 7</container><container id="aspace_697fe10673a39675f9cff0131617e1a2" parent="aspace_a2bb4e033da293407312b249883f75aa" type="item">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref140_pzo" level="file"><did><unittitle>First Dutch Reformed Church ("The Old Bushwick Church L.I.

There are also several scenic prints of engravings of scenes from around New York State similar to the prints of engravings of scenes from Brooklyn and New York City in <emph render="bold">Sub-Series 2: Brooklyn and New York City Graphic Materials</emph>.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref148_1dh" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Nathanial Hawthorn (engraving w/ signature)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1854/1854" type="inclusive">1854</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_b53a95f22d121ebfdef12c169046fa46" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">5</container><container id="aspace_c70dba0d5b7ae90dd35522fee0c96657" parent="aspace_b53a95f22d121ebfdef12c169046fa46" type="Folder">26</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref149_3l8" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York State Scenic Prints</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1837/1838" type="inclusive">1837-1838</unitdate><container altrender="Large Flat Box" id="aspace_e246b32abbe97a9ae4f25af632f88b1e" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">OS 7</container><container id="aspace_8ac80b9355f443cdacb512f334dc2c85" parent="aspace_e246b32abbe97a9ae4f25af632f88b1e" type="item">13</container></did><odd id="aspace_f548919516363fe5e235d3b155160b3a"><head>General</head><p>Moved to Mold Box 2:

The collection also contains the newsletters "The Forest Leaf" and "The Melodeon" which were produced for social service benefit purposes following the Civil War. Clippings from the 20th Century primarily concern the Lefferts house, the archaeological work associated with it, its eventual move to Prospect Park in 1918, and the place of the Lefferts family and house in early New York Dutch history.

id="aspace_a57bd4f1495f0e4974ef36e00a7cabd8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The <emph render="bold">Books and Scrapbooks</emph> series contains a variety of books which were either created by or maintained by the Lefferts family or acquired by the attendants of the Lefferts Historical House Museum. Books were kept within the collection if they had a strong connection to the Lefferts family or the Lefferts Historical House, if they had a strong connection to the life of the Lefferts particular to colonial American history, or if they included important inscriptions, marginalia, or notations and correspondence.</p><p>There are a variety of religious books and bibles within the series including four very large bibles. Three of these bibles are in Dutch and date from the mid-17th Century to the mid-18th Century. The oversized Dutch Bibles are published by Hendrick and Jacob Keur and the oversized English Bible is published by Benjamin Kennicott. These family bibles were likely important pieces of the Lefferts household and many included handwritten accounts of family births, deaths, and marriages. Many of these documents have been moved to the <emph render="bold">Genealogical Material</emph> series but the Dutch Keur Bible from 1741 still includes some inscriptions of Cowenhoven family and Lefferts family births and deaths. In addition to the large family bibles, there are also several editions of the small Het Nieuwe Testament. The Reformed Dutch Church of Flatbush pointed out in its "Quarter Milllennial Anniversary" booklet (1904) that "it is probable that all the Dutch families own one or more of these books still" indicating the importance of this New Testament in Dutch to the religious families of Flatbush with Dutch heritage even into the 20th Century.</p><p>There are some cookbooks and housekeeping guides included in this series. Most notable of these is the handwritten cookbook that was likely compiled by Maria Lott Lefferts and Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt. This cookbook also contains a loose page of recipes and some sewing threads that were left inside the book. Some of the printed cookbooks also contain handwritten recipes in the margins.
