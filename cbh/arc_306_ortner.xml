    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Everett H. Ortner was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, on August 25, 1919. When he was child his family relocated to Brooklyn, New York. He attended P.S. 99, Jamaica High School, and James Madison High School, from which he graduated in 1935. He attended the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1939. He then entered the U.S. Army as an officer and trained at Fort Benning, Georgia. In 1945 he was deployed to the European theater of World War II, where he was wounded in action and taken prisoner. He received a Bronze Star Medal for his service in 1948. After the war he was employed as an editor at <emph render="italic">Popular Science</emph> magazine from 1952 until his retirement in 1985.</p><p>Evelyn F. Gelbman was born in Manhattan on July 4, 1924. She was raised in the north Bronx and attended Washington Irving High School, graduating in 1942. She then attended Hunter College, graduating in 1952. Later she studied design at Parsons School of Design and Pratt Institute, and historic preservation at Columbia University. She was employed as an interior designer from the 1950s to the 2000s, and was a design columnist for the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Heights Press</emph> and <emph render="italic">Homeowners How To Handbook</emph>. She was also the Director of Facilities and Collections for the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry from 1979 to 1984, where she curated the organization's archives and portrait collection.</p><p>The Ortners married in 1953. They lived in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn in the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1963 the couple purchased an 1882 four-story brownstone at 272 Berkeley Place in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. This would be the catalyst for their involvement in the "Brownstone Revival" movement. The Ortners soon became active in a variety of community organizations. They lobbied local banks to provide mortgages to prospective Park Slope home-buyers at a time when lenders had "red-lined" the neighborhood. According to the Park Slope Civic Council, "they also encouraged the Brooklyn Union Gas Co. (now National Grid) to purchase and transform a dilapidated brownstone on Berkeley Place into a modern two-family home featuring a variety of gas appliances." These buildings became known as "Cinderella homes" and were used in advertising to entice new residents to the neighborhood. The couple were also a leading force in the designation of the Park Slope Historic District in 1973.</p><p>Starting in the 1960s, Everett was involved with the Park Slope Civic Council (as photographer and vice-president), the Park Slope Betterment Committee (founder), the Brownstone Revival Committee of New York (co-founder and president), the Back to the City Conference (co-founder and president), the Montauk Club (board member and president), the Brooklyn Historical Society/Long Island Historical Society (board member and vice-president), and Preservation Volunteers (co-founder with Evelyn). Evelyn was involved with the Brooklyn Academy of Music (board member), Brooklyn Museum (president of the Community Committee), the St. Ann Center for Restoration and the Arts (co-founder and chairman of the board), Brooklyn Stained Glass Conservation Center (vice-president and board member), the Long Island Historical Society (member), the Montauk Club (board member), the Victorian Society in America (New York Chapter, board member and secretary), the Fine Arts Federation of New York (board member), the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment (board member), Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn (board member), and Preservation Volunteers (co-founder with Everett). </p><p>The Ortners were the recipients of numerous awards and honors, including the Brooklyn Union Gas Company's Cinderella Award (1978), the Preservation League of New York State's Excellence in Historic Preservation Award (2002), and the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Lucy G. Moses Preservation Leadership Award (2005).</p><p>Evelyn Ortner died at 272 Berkeley Place on September 19, 2006 at age 82. Everett followed on May 22, 2012, at age 92.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Harris, Elizabeth A.

Ortner, dating from 1972 to 1991. It includes snapshots and copy negatives of historic images taken by Ortner. The photographs document Brooklyn (especially buildings, landmarks, and festivals), Manhattan (buildings), friends, and travels. Some photographs were taken while Ortner was attending Back to the City conferences in St. Paul (MN) and Hartford (CT). Ortner was an amateur photographer and notes regarding the type of film and cameras he used are sometimes included in the file title of the negatives. Additional copies of some of these images can be found in <emph render="bolditalic">Sub-series 4.3: Brooklyn and Historic Preservation slides</emph>. Of note are photographs of the removal of the "Herald of Peace" statue from the Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch in Grand Army Plaza.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

35mm slides, mostly taken by Everett Ortner, dating from 1959 to 2005. The majority of the slides were used in lectures delivered by Ortner. Files related to these lectures can be found in <emph render="bolditalic">Series 5: Brooklyn and Historic Preservation lectures</emph>. Geographically the slides cover Brooklyn (especially the neighborhood of Park Slope) and Manhattan. They predomidantly feature buildings, as well as festivals (especially the Atlantic Antic and the Giglio Feast of Williamsburg), landmarks, and the waterfront. The sub-series also includes numerous copy slides of historic Brooklyn images. In addition to lecture slides, the subseries contains a small amount of personal photographs.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7a7ac09711c9649517d5988816369e4e"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically by title.

There are four series of numbered slides in the set: One numbered 1-120, which was missing slides 54-55, 108-109, and 111-112; one numbered 181-187; one numbered 37-54, of which the 49th slide was labeled "No Pix"; and one numbered 1-19, which was missing slide 3.

It contains a small of amount of historical memorabilia, including an engraving print of the First Methodist Episcopal Church, a Brooklyn Young Republicans ribbon, and a menu from Trommer's restaurant. Architectural drawings for buildings on the south side of Ninth Street (east of Eighth Avenue) in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn are also available in the series.</p><p>The series documents several Brooklyn organizations, including the Park Slope Betterment Committee, Park Slope Block Association, Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), Brooklyn Museum, Long Island Historical Society/Brooklyn Historical Society (LIHS/BHS), Brownstone Revival Committee/Coalition, Brooklyn Union Gas Company's Cinderella projects, and Preservation Volunteers. Of particular note are the files relating to the Park Slope Betterment Committee, which was established in the mid-1960s and was a precursor to the Park Slope Civic Council.

Starting in the 1960s, the company purchased and refurbished abandoned brownstones in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn in order to attract new residents to the neighborhood. EGO designed and furnished the interiors of the first Cinderella home at 211 Berkeley Place in 1968, and EHO was vocal proponent of the program. In 1978 the Ortners recieved the company's Cinderella Award, and were featured in Brooklyn Union Gas Company advertisements.</p><p>The series consists of publications, correspondence, films, histories on the program and the company, and ephemera, dating from 1968 to 2008.
