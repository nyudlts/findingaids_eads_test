<p>The Park Slope Civic Council records is made up of materials generated by the Park Slope Civic Council (PSCC) administration and members, especially those involved with PSCC's newsletter <emph>Civic News</emph> and the Board of Trustees. Materials include correspondence, meeting agendas and minutes, newsletters, newspaper clippings, photographs, negatives, slides, blueprints, and posters.</p><p>Much of the collection is made up of Irene Wilson's correspondence and subject files from when she was editor of <emph>Civic News</emph> in the 1960s and 1970s, and Carl Kaiserman's files from the 1980s through the early 2000s. Kaiserman was a PSCC trustee and active in Revitalization of the Southern Area of the Slope (ROSAS). Park Slope House Tour planning and promotional materials from 1959 to 2018 and research materials related to PSCC's Landmark Campaign to receive NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission Historic District designation also make up a significant portion of the collection.</p><p>While there are materials dated from the 1930s, this collection does not contain many records from when the organization was the South Brooklyn Board of Trade. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Park Slope Civic Council (PSCC) was founded in 1896 as the South Brooklyn Board of Trade, which acted as a chamber of commerce, lobbying the city and state for improvements to infrastructure and services across the geographic area south of Downtown Brooklyn. One of the founders and first president was Alexander G. Calder. In the late 1950s, the South Brooklyn Board of Trade renamed itself the Park Slope Civic Council to increase residents' engagement in the neighborhood. </p><p>As the Park Slope Civic Council, the organization regularly publishes the <emph>Civic News</emph> newsletter, reviews changing building regulations and developments, provides grants to neighborhood projects, and organizes fundraising activities such as the annual House Tour. PSCC acts as a conduit between members and political representatives. </p><p>PSCC led the campaign that achieved historic district designation for the section of Park Slope closest to Prospect Park in 1973. The Council continued its historic district advocacy in the late 1990s, planning to expand the historic district designation to the north, south, and west.</p><p>In 2001, Revitalization of the Southern Area of the Slope (ROSAS), a neighborhood association active in the neighborhood south of Park Slope since 1978, merged with the Park Slope Civic Council, bringing the activities of both organizations under one umbrella.</p>  </bioghist>

In the 1990s, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) started working on the Gowanus Expressway Project to find ways to address traffic congestion and structural deterioration. Community groups in the area, especially the Gowanus Expressway Community Coalition and the Gowanus Community Stakeholder Group, weighed in on the alternatives that the NYSDOT presented and largely supported a tunnel alternative to the Gowanus Expressway.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_25cbff8611dc7ac013ca08a69353252f" level="file"><did><unittitle>[Gowanus Community Stakeholder Group, tunnel

In 1986, a Human Resources Administration (HRA) women's shelter occupied part of the building. The HRA planned to close the shelter and open an intake and evaluation center in 1990, but community backlash and the womens' refusal to leave the building kept the shelter open. In 1991, the shelter did close and in 1994, the city launched a study of how best to use the building with consultants from Pratt Institute and City University of New York. Around this same time, military presence was being withdrawn from the building and the city was renting out the space for film shoots.</p><p>The Armory was officially given to the city in 1996. In 2010, a Prospect Park YMCA sports complex opened up in the space.</p></bioghist><arrangement id="aspace_63d71056846564e612295ae9c07bf1a5"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The sub-series is in original
