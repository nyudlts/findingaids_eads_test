    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>David L. Anderson was born around 1885 in Sweden. Various dates of immigration to the U.S. are given in censuses, ranging from 1900 to 1908. In 1910 the young man was a lodger in a boarding house at 144 Henry St, with the profession of "Draftsman—Electric machinery." In the 1915 New York State census he is living at 235 Walnut Street in Queens with wife Alma and two sons. By 1920 he is on 106th St in Queens, with wife Alma P. aged 31, and sons Harold and "Wilbur" (perhaps Willem) aged 8 and 6. A fifth member of the household is Josephine Peterson, mother-in-law, age 62, widow. Like Mr. Anderson, Mrs. Peterson came from Sweden. His profession is given as "Master mechanic—Linotype."</p><p>In 1930 the family lived at 150 Senator Street. David L. Anderson is a widower. His age at first marriage is given as 25 and he is listed as a "Master mechanic—Intertype Machines." His son Harold, now 19, is a general clerk at Standard Oil while Willem, 16 appears to be still at school. During that year Mr. Anderson made a trip to England, returning from Southampton on the Mauretania, which arrived in New York on 28 August, 1930. The ship's records note that he was naturalized at the Federal Court in Brooklyn on 29 May, 1910.</p><p>Of Mrs. David L. Anderson, evidently a second wife, we know nothing at time of writing.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The series that comprise the Mrs. David L. Anderson Collection appear unrelated except as regards their donor.</p><p>Series 1. Documents relating to the Intertype Corporation. David Anderson was head of Research and Development at the Intertype Corporation, a manufacturer of typesetting machinery based in Brooklyn. The papers in series 1 record social events as well as business operations and activities of different divisions of the company, with dates ranging from 1914 to 1967</p><p>Series 2 comprises papers relating to the East New York Community Corporation, including job descriptions, training materials, personnel manuals and documents on the Corporation's leasing of 505 Sutter Ave. The date range is 1968-1973.</p><p>Series 3 consists of single annual reports, catalogues etc. from a variety of Brooklyn charitable and educational institutions, mostly dating from 1867.</p><p>In Series 4 can be found various pamphlets, speeches, sermons etc, some of them having only a tenuous connection to Brooklyn (for example, the Dictionary of Chinook Jargon bears the ownership stamp of J. Jay Pierrepont, carrier of a well-known Brooklyn name.) The date range is 1842-1887.</p><p>Series 5 contains a handwritten genealogy of the Davenport family with pasted-in printed genealogical tables. Two letters dated 1850 were found laid into the manuscript.</p>  </scopecontent>
