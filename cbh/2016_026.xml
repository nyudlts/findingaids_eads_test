    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Brooklyn For Peace records document the founding and ongoing activities of a Brooklyn-based community organization, Brooklyn For Peace (formerly Brooklyn Parents for Peace), covering the years 1984-2018. With over thirty years of work as a New York-based activist organization, BFP's institutional records reveal both the history of the organization as well as the grassroots response to a wide variety of significant social and political issues at the local, regional and national levels from the late twentieth century to the present. In particular, the records document BFP's organizational structure, key campaigns and projects, public events, and petitions circulated. These topics are represented through meeting minutes, mailings, internal correspondence, financial records, audio-visual material, and event ephemera including flyers, artwork and banners. The collection also includes substantial documentation of other local, regional and international organizations and individuals, through extensive subject files collected by BFP's leadership. Social and political issues that are particularly well represented in the collection include the campaign for nuclear disarmament, anti-war organizing from the Gulf War through the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Brooklyn For Peace (BFP) was founded in 1984 as Brooklyn Parents for Peace by Charlotte Phillips and Carolyn Eisenberg, in response to the invasion of Grenada by the United States. Since then, through public events, publicity campaigns, lobbying of elected officials, and demonstrations, Brooklyn For Peace has worked to eliminate war and the social injustices that are its causes. The organization works on domestic and international issues in an attempt to create a peaceful future. BFP operates as a membership-based, democratic, non-partisan, 501(c)3 corporation run by a Board of Directors. </p><p>Over the course of thirty years, BFP has worked on a wide range of issues pertaining to local, regional and international peace issues. BFP's committees have included: Arts and Culture, Anti-militarism (counter-recruitment), Climate Action, Darfur/Africa, Diversity and Outreach, Fundraising, International Law, Israel-Palestine, Latin America, Nuclear Zero, Peace and Economic Justice, Peace Fair, and UNICEF. There are several affiliated neighborhood-focused peace groups in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bay Ridge, Flatbush, Fort Greene, and Prospect-Lefferts Gardens. Regular efforts of BFP include organizing community meetings and forums, staffing information tables at relevant community and regional events, participating in phone and advertising campaigns, lobbying elected officials, participating in demonstrations, and providing didactic materials pertaining to targeted areas that fall within the mission of the organization.  </p><p>BFP's earliest projects included organizing local opposition to a proposed Staten Island port for nuclear-capable cruise missiles, as well as protesting U.S. interventions in Central America and the 1991 Gulf War. Following September 11th, BFP advocated for the protection of civil liberties and opposed the detention of immigrants. In response to the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, BFP sought to limit military recruiting in New York City public schools. This included distributing leaflets such as "How to Go to College Without Joining the Military." </p><p>BFP has organized against the wars in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan, against police brutality in New York City, and for a peaceful solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. More recently, BFP has joined in community opposition to fracking, to the Rockaway Pipeline, and to the Liquefied Natural Gas port on Long Island. From 2003 until 2012 BFP hosted a regular Peace and Justice Fair. The Peace Fair included musical and theater performances, educational sessions and discussions, and was primarily intended as an outreach forum. In 2013 the event was replaced by the Pathmakers to Peace Gala. Additionally, since 2006 BFP has hosted a monthly program "War No More" on BRIC's Brooklyn Community Access TV station. </p>  </bioghist>

leadership, this series includes 20 dated volumes of material representing the work of the organization, including events, meetings, discussions, interests, and conflicts. Material in this series consists primarily of event ephemera, newspaper clippings, informational pamphlets, correspondence, Brooklyn-based publications, and a small amount of administrative records. Volumes are organized by time period and cover BFP's involvement in the community throughout their existence, with a focus on the years 2003 through 2011. This series offers an overview of what BFP was doing in the community, what interested them as an organization, and what BFP's leadership felt was important to represent and document as an organization.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_03b8b2162b9952b6deaaa257cd9ca053"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Material in this series has been arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c

Event recordings include cassettes, CD, VHS and DVD recordings of panel discussions, protests, and the Brooklyn Peace Fair. Subjects that are well represented are the Israel-Palestine conflict, the role of money in politics, local and national climate policy, and nuclear disarmament.
