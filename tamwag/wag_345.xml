Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Labor Movement Serials groups 2,116 titles published between 1891 and 2012 mainly chronicling the labor movement in the 20th century, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, bulletins, and mailings distributed by unions, national and local chapters of labor organizations, rank and file groups, government agencies, and advocacy groups. The serials document the activities of individual unions and organizations as well as the trajectory of the labor movement more broadly, with discussions on labor law and government policy, relationships and solidarity between affinity groups, and the concerns of particular constituencies of workers. Serials in this collection range from official publications and proceedings regularly distributed by large, AFL-CIO-affiliated organizations to pamphlets and printed matter informally circulated by organizers to announce meetings and actions. In addition to serials chronicling the labor movement in the United States, there are significant quantities of material relating to labor conditions in Europe and Canada.</abstract>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>This collection combines serials relating to the labor movement drawn from two discrete groups of material held by the Tamiment Library. The first was a partially inventoried backlog of serials, received by the library through donations, subscriptions, and in archival collections. The second group consisted of around 1,700 serials, newspapers, and magazines, organized by title as an artificial collection, referred to as Periodicals.001 or Boxed Newspapers. This material was combined, inventoried, and arranged and described in subject-based categories in 2017.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>This collection imposes an artificial arrangement on a range of disparate material separated from the order in which it was originally received at Tamiment Library. The material is separated into five series, dividing serials into groups of topically similar material. The first series largely collects serials issued by labor unions, grouping this material into 12 narrower subseries, according to a union's trade or constituency. The remaining series collect concentrations of similar types of material, for example labor newspapers, or material originating from outside the United States. Within each series, material is arranged at the file level, in alphabetical order by publishing organization. Where possible issues of each publication are organized chronologically, grouped by year. Each title is listed alongside its publishing organization and city of origin, where this information is available.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The material in this collection was assembled from various backlogs of uncataloged material held by the Tamiment Library. This material was inventoried, separated according to its subject matter, and arranged in a series of subject-based artificial collections. Accumulations of similar material relating to the labor movement were identified -- volumes of daily labor newspapers; serials and pamphlets issued by labor research organizations -- informing five series of material, grouping material by genre (Labor News), provenance (International Labor Organizations), or topic (Labow Law; Labor Research). A taxonomy used within the Tamiment Library, delineating affinities between different industries and unions in detail, was used to structure the 12 subseries of Series I. Within each series, serials are arranged alphabetically by publishing organization, with titles generally listed alongside their publishing organization and place of publication.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Labor Movement Serials groups 2,116 titles published between 1891 and 2012 mainly chronicling the labor movement in the 20th century, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. </p><p>The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, bulletins, and mailings distributed by unions, national and local chapters of labor organizations, rank and file groups, government agencies, and advocacy groups. The serials document the activities of individual unions and organizations -- meetings, elections, appointments, negotiations -- as well as the fluctuating trajectories of the labor movement more broadly, with discussions on labor law and government policy, relationships and solidarity between affinity groups, and the concerns of particular constituencies of workers. Serials in this collection range from official publications and conference proceedings regularly distributed by large, AFL-CIO-affiliated organizations to pamphlets and printed matter informally circulated by organizers to announce meetings and actions. Among the larger organizations represented in this collection are the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; the Communication Workers of America; the American Federation of Teachers; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; and Teamsters for a Democratic Union, as well as prominent labor coalitions in New York State like the United Federation of Teachers and the New York City Central Labor Council. Notable titles include <emph>American Postal Worker</emph>; <emph>Labor Chronicle</emph>; <emph>United Labor Action</emph>; <emph>United Teacher</emph>; <emph>Working Teamster</emph>; <emph>The NMU Pilot</emph>; <emph>Solidarity</emph>, issued by the Labor Committee of the New York Students for a Democratic Society; and the Philadelphia Workers' Organizing Committee's <emph>Organizer</emph>. </p><p>The trades and professions represented in this collection form a comprehensive cross-section of organized labor in the 20th century, encompassing bulletins from unions and rank and file groups representing the building trades, communications workers, public employees, transport employee unions, education and entertainment unions, farmworkers and longshoremen, retail and service workers, and coalitions representing demographics working across different sectors, for example the Jewish Labor Committee.</p><p>In addition to the material documenting the activities of unions in America, the collection also includes a series dedicated to labor research and history, and a collection of trade journals and labor newspapers. Around 300 titles originate from outside the United States, with significant quantities of Canadian and European publications, often representing international bodies or research groups discussing labor policy. No complete runs of publications are contained herein, and generally only a handful of issues of each publication are held.</p>  </scopecontent>

different industries, including publications issued by Asian-American organizations and staff groups (Asian Americans for Equal Employment; Chinese Staff and Workers Association); African-American workers (the Black Workers Congress; Coalition of Revolutionary Black Workers; Coalition of Black Trade Unionists); religious organizations (The Workmen's Circle; Histradut); and women's groups (Non-Traditional Employment for Women; Women for Economic Justice; Union Women's Alliance to Gain Equality). Featuring many organizations based in New York City, and largely dating from the 1970s to the 1990s, publications often combine local community news with writing around labor activism, detailing the living and working conditions of factory workers, restaurant staff, and sleeping car porters, among others.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_d11acfbf064f6639e57f359e9ad93cf0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Update on Kenya : African-American Labor Center, Washington, DC</unittitle><unitid>cuid10169</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1993/1993" type="inclusive">1993</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_0661ce2f8ed87b8a2f807f3074c4e0a6" label="Mixed Materials [31142063008802]" type="Box">27</container><container id="aspace_44e12a8950b3f899ab53a963b8b9e7ac" parent="aspace_0661ce2f8ed87b8a2f807f3074c4e0a6" type="Folder">21</container></did></c><c id="aspace_493241911f69b4ba19b5b48877ef7b57" level="file"><did><unittitle>Update on Malawi : African-American Labor Center, Washington, DC</unittitle><unitid>cuid10170</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1993/1993" type="inclusive">1993</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_4b230326a8acdb73e84da424a1e26fa6" label="Mixed Materials [31142063008802]" type="Box">27</container><container id="aspace_3faf891073d9535c2d075c6aaaef0b90" parent="aspace_4b230326a8acdb73e84da424a1e26fa6" type="Folder">22</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6917e23b5bc46f89f2c4f99f619064de" level="file"><did><unittitle>WomeNews : AFTRA National Women's Committee, Los Angeles, CA</unittitle><unitid>cuid10171</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_c31d9207ee5ca27f6f21dcf4df6796a5" label="Mixed Materials [31142063008802]" type="Box">27</container><container id="aspace_e84a5caa3a1ca0f3abf7fc2892909b53" parent="aspace_c31d9207ee5ca27f6f21dcf4df6796a5" type="Folder">23</container></did></c><c id="aspace_dad1f19dd3d8e4c792980006ce803df0" level="file"><did><unittitle>A.S.U.
