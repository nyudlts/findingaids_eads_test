    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Jack O'Brien (May 16, 1938) is an engaged member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) District of Columbia State Board. He has been active in various efforts to install memorials to significant Irish and Irish American people and serves as National Co-Chairman of the John Barry Memorial Project. In 2015, he was selected to be the Grand Marshal of the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Washington, D.C. Between the 1970s and 1990s, O'Brien was a member of various Irish American organizations, such as the Irish Northern Aid Committee, and helped to raise money to support the on-going Republican movement in Northern Ireland. He continues to champion Irish history and Irish culture through his participation in Irish heritage festivals, St. Patrick's Day parades, as well as with his patronage of institutions like the Irish Railroad Workers Museum and the Irish American Cultural Institute.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Jack O'Brien Papers consists of materials created and collected by O'Brien regarding his engagement with the Washington, D.C. Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), his interest in republicanism related to Northern Ireland, Brexit's impact on Ireland, Irish history and culture, as well as his involvement to create and install physical memorials to significant figures in Irish and Irish American history.</p><p>The first three series of this collection relates to various aspects of the "The Troubles" in Northern Ireland. The Troubles refers to the 30 year conflict between Nationalists (Irish or Roman Catholics) and Unionists (British or Protestants). Series I: The Troubles in Northern Ireland focuses upon the actual conflict itself between the mid-1960s to 1998, Series II: Northern Ireland Post Troubles focuses upon the legacy of the Troubles after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, and Series III: Belfast Project (Boston College and the IRA Tapes) examines the legal battles between Boston College and the British authorities attempting to obtain copies of IRA oral histories recorded as part of Boston College's "Belfast Project."  It should be noted, due to the large volume of materials within the Jack O'Brien Papers that specifically addressed the 1981 Hunger Strike, Irish American Organzations active during the Troubles, controversial U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaties, and news coverage of this period, specific sub-series related to each of these topics was created. </p><p>The latter half of the Jack O'Brien Papers focuses upon O'Brien's personal interests and affiliations. Series IV and VI are related as they both focus upon Irish history. O'Brien was integral to the creation of many monuments commemorating great Irish individuals, such as Commodore John Barry, Irish military units, such as the Irish Brigade, as well as important events in Irish history, such as the Great Famine. These activities are documented in Series IV: Monuments and Commemorations. Series VI: Irish History provides historical context for subjects like the Irish Brigade, the Great Famine, the Fenian Movement, the Easter Rising, and Irish involvment in the Revolutionary War. </p><p>Jack O'Brien continues to be an active member of the AOH and his participation is reflected in the materials found within Series V. This series contains information pertaining to the history of the AOH, divisional newsletters recounting the activities of various branches of the AOH, fundraising efforts, AOH convention materials, as well as numerous copies of the AOH newspaper, <emph render = "italic">The National Hibernian Digest</emph>.</p><p>Finally, Series VII: Jack O'Brien - Personal Materials, documents O'Brien's patronage of various Irish American institutions like the Irish American Cultural Institute and Irish Railroad Workers Museum, his family history, his love of Ireland and his Irish heritage, as well as his continued enagement with his local Irish American community through events like the St. Patrick's Day Parade and Irish Festivals. </p><p>Materials in this collection include correspondence, flyers, newsletters, photographs, newspapers, speeches, official reports, press releases, interviews, book excerpts, posters, newspaper clippings, stickers, brochures, vinyl records, VHS tapes, CDs, an audio reel, St. Patrick's Day magazines, business cards, buttons, email printouts, legal documents, government documents, architectural drawings, and commemorative materials. </p>  </scopecontent>

This agreement ended most of the violence in Northern Ireland and is considered the end point of the Troubles. This series focuses upon efforts towards a united Ireland, Brexit, Sinn Fein, as well as the legacy of the Troubles such as the arrest of Gerry Adams for the murder of Jean McConville and new evidence regarding the murder of Patrick Finucane.

The Belfast Project interviewed former Provisional IRA members such as Dolours Price and Anthony McIntyre, both of whom recounted their experiences in the IRA. This series mostly contains materials related to the 2011 controversy surrounding the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and British government subpoenaing the Belfast Project's transcripts in connection with the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in 1972. The series documents the outrage experienced by the Irish American community and supporters of Boston College by the PSNI and British government's actions, as well as the legal ramifications of the subpoena.</p><p>This series contains newspaper clippings, correspondence, legal documents, emails, press statements, and memorandum.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_9e3398f2019d231c984eed4bb323d2a1"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The materials in this series have been arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_703e76889e3ca81a3195e35a98f549f6" level="file"><did><unittitle>ACLU Brief</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2012/2012">2012</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
