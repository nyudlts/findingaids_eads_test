    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Graduate Student Organizing Committee (GSOC) represents graduate and research assistants at New York University (NYU) and is affiliated with the United Auto Workers Local 2110. GSOC was the first graduate employee union at a private university to successfully negotiate a contract, in effect from 2001 to 2005, which included major improvements to stipends, benefits and employee rights. In 2004 the National Labor Relations Board reversed the legal precedent of the Brown University decision, which required private universities to negotiate with graduate employees. NYU administration then refused to bargain with GSOC after the expiry of the first contract, leading to a six month strike in 2005-2006. In 2013, following a GSOC petition to the NLRB to reverse the Brown University decision, the NYU administration announced that they would resume collective bargaining with GSOC on the withdrawal of the NLRB petition. GSOC remains the only graduate employee union at a private university in the United States.</p>  </bioghist>

Local 2110) is the union for graduate employees at New York University (NYU) and the Polytechnic Institute of New York University. This includes teaching assistants, research assistants, and graduate assistants. The Polytechnic Institute organizes science and engineering graduate students. The union was established in 1998 and negotiated their first contract with NYU in 2002. In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board reversed the Brown University decision, declaring private universities are not required to bargain with graduate employees and leading to NYU not negotiating a new contract. Capture of the website began in 2009, which contained information on the history of GSOC, their contract, press converage, press releases, member information, and action campaigns. Capture of  http://www.makingabetternyu.org/ began in 2013, containing information about the union and its Polytechnic Institute (later Tandon) affiliate (SET-UAW), campaigns, news, healthcare petition, and event listings. Over time, the website has been updated to include their current contract, bargaining information, solidarity statements and resolutions, caucuses, and documentation on the union's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and demands to NYU administration to support graduate student workers. </p><p>This series also includes the websites for the New York University Academic Workers for a Democratic Union the social justice caucus of GSOC. https://collectiveactiongetsthegoods.tumblr.com/ contained their principles, 2014 bargaining report, statements of solidarity with other striking graduate students unions, bargaining updates, information on elections and strikes in 2014-2015, and news from the union. https://nyuawdu.wordpress.com/ was captured starting in 2020, when GSOC began bargaining for a new contract. The website contains their bargaining platform, bargaining committee members, updates, and fliers.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_b843bf8cf1c21df05dfd68e369e1c55d"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
