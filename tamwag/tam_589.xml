The Center was initially established to provide legal services and financial support to lawyers representing civil rights movement activists in Mississippi, but has since broaded its focus to civil liberties and human rights activism and litigation more generally. This unprocessed collection of records created or collected by CCR consists of correspondence, political ephemera, newspaper clippings, websites, research files, and legal documents, including briefs, motions, and trial transcripts documenting the organization's legal advocacy.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) is a non-profit legal advocacy organization based on New York City. It was founded in 1966 by civil rights lawyers and legal activists, including William Kuntsler, Morton Stavis, Arthur Kinoy, and Ben Smith. The Center was initially established to provide legal services and financial support to lawyers representing civil rights movement activists in Mississippi. Since then, CCR has broadened its focus to civil liberties and human rights activism and litigation more generally, providing legal assistance to a variety of clients, including Guantanamo Bay detainment camp prisoners and victims of racial profiling in the wake of 9/11.</p>

          <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
          <p>Capture of the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) website began in 2007 at http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp. The website contained news, press releases, pamphlets, and fact sheets from the organization. It also includes education and outreach information on police brutality, alternatives to incarceration, prison phone contract monopolies, reparations, and the Movement Support Resource Center. Their legal programs in 2007 focused on international human rights, government misconduct, racial and economic justice, September 11, Cuba travel ban, corporate accountability, and Guantánamo Bay. In 2008, the organization's URL changed to http://www.ccrjustice.org/. The website then included a legal glossary, their newsletter and press releases, press about CCR, and their legal docket on issues such as illegal dentention and Guantánamo, surveillance and attacks on dissent, criminal justice and mass incarceration, corporate human rights abuse, government abuse of power, racial, gender, and economic justice, and international law and accountability. In 2015, the website went through another redeisgn and expanded their case load to cases related to abusive immigration practices, corporate human rights abuses, criminalizing disset, discrimatory policiting, drone killings, government surveillance, Guantánamo Bay, LGBTQIA+ persecution, mass incarceration, Muslim profiling, Palestinian solidarity, racial injustice, sexual and gender-based violence, and torture, war crimes, and militarism. The website at the time also highlights the Bertha Justice Institute, an arm of CCR to support early career lawyers and legal workers. In 2015, they also launched their blog, the Daily Outrage. In 2018, CCR launched the Activist Files, a podcast that features stories of activists, lawyers, and artists fighting for justice. The website also shifted to highlighting more ways to get involved with CCR, through internships, fellowships, volunteering, job opportunities, events, fact sheets, reports, client profiles, testimony, and advocacy videos.</p>
          <p>FOIA Basics for Activists is a resource guide created by the Center for Constitutional Rights to assist activists, organizers, and social movements in filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to aid their ongoing campaigns and work. It is primarily focused on using FOIA to file requests with federal agencies like the FBI or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It also includes case studies annotated examples, as well as a PDF of the guide. </p>
          <p>If An Agent Knocks is a pamphlet created by the Center for Constitutional Rights to to provide advice to activists likely to be targeted by FBI or other federal agents who have a history of targeting radical and progressive movements. This is the 2020 update to the original 1989 guide and includes more information for non-US citizens. </p>
