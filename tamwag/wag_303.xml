      <abstract id="aspace_4592d714993a4038bed3629201a41da6">Mae Kaplan Millstone (1913-2009) was a newspaper section editor, union organizer, and activist for the labor movement and women's issues. Harry Millstone (1907-1999) was a union organizer, instructor, and activist for the labor movement. Mae and Harry met in Detroit while organizing with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and married in 1938. The Mae and Harry Millstone Papers contain material documenting their work and support for labor unions and the labor movement, both separately and together. Of note in this collection is a digital recording of the 2005 video interviews with Mae describing her life-long work and support for the labor movement, as well as her activism, dating from the 1930s to the 2000s. This collection also contains appointment books, as well as print material, training course manuals, and newsletters related to labor organizing. A scrapbook from the 1960s and subject files pertaining to women's issues document Mae's editorial work for the women's section of <emph render="italic">The Gazette and Daily</emph> in York, Pennsylvania. Family papers include travel diaries, ephemera, correspondence, and audio recordings and lyric sheets for labor movement-related songs.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Mae Kaplan Millstone (1913-2009) graduated with a Master's degree in Sociology from Pennsylvania State University in 1934, and worked during the mid-1930s for the National Industrial Recovery Administration as a Special Investigator through the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. She moved to Detroit in 1936 where she met Harry Millstone (1907-1999), who was a unionizer for the CIO at the time. They married in 1938. In 1941 they moved to Williamsport, Pennsylvania and Mae left the workforce to raise their two children, but continued to volunteer in consumer and voter registration activities. The family moved to York, Pennsylvania in 1961, where Mae became the editor of the women's section for <emph render="italic">The Gazette and Daily</emph> newspaper. She also stayed active in her community by co-founding the group York Action for Peace, and continued her support of the labor movement. She was also active in the York Chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) and volunteered for Planned Parenthood. Harry was employed by Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America for many years as a union organizer and retired in 1973. He continued to educate others, teaching various courses on union organizing at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies during the 1980s. In 1999 he received the Pillar of Labor from the Tamiment Library and Wagner Labor Archives.</p>

      <p>The Mae and Harry Millstone Papers (dated 1910-2009) consist of materials created and collected by Mae and Harry Millstone over the course of their lives as they worked and advocated for labor unions and workers' rights. This collection also includes files related to specific jobs held by Mae and Harry, as well as material representing them as a family and their combined interests. 
Files in this collection document Mae's work in the 1930s as a government investigator of the working conditions of women and children workers, as well as her involvement with the U.S. Office of Price Administration Labor Advisory Committee during World War II. This collection also includes material accumulated by Harry during his time with the Army Service Forces for the Quartermaster at Camp Lee in the 1940s.

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series contains material related to the work and activism of Mae Kaplan Millstone. Early files include a small amount of school papers from the 1920s and 1930s. Reports, charts, and notes in this series document her work in the mid-1930s as an investigator for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Bureau of Women and Children regarding work environments and compliance. Mae's engagement calendars include daily entries of her life and work dating from 1959 to 2005. This series also includes Russian and Chinese language class papers, exercises, and audio recordings. Mae's scrapbook in this series contains women's sections of the York, Pennsylvania <emph render="italic">The Gazette and Daily</emph> from 1962, which was early in her tenure as editor. The subject files in this series were accumulated by Mae during the 1970s, either for use as part of her editing work or as personal reference files. These files reflect issues Mae perceived as affecting and impacting women, including affirmative action, contraception, the Equal Rights Amendement (ERA), feminism, health, religion, sports, and gender descrimination in the workplace. Her files include material on issues that not only affected her directly, but also affected women of color, and women living and working in countries outside the United States including China, Central America, South America, and Japan. These files typically contain press clippings, booklets, and brochures, and include a 1971 copy of <emph render="italic">Our Bodies, Ourselves</emph>. Mae's involvement in the national and York Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) is illustrated through her collection of organizational publications, photographs, event notices, and print material dating from the 1970s to 1980s. An event program and planning notes for a 1998 banquet in her honor hosted by the York Chapter of NOW is also in this series. Other honors and awards include a 1947 War Service Award for her work serving on the U.S. Office of Price Administration Labor Advisory Committee; and a parade program for her role as Grand Marshall for the 2005 York Labor Day Parade. Of particular note in this series is a digital recording of a 6.5 hour long 2005 video interview conducted by her son, David Millstone, in which Mae reflects on her personal life, work, and life-long activism in support of women's issues, world peace, and the labor movement.</p>

          <p>This series contains material accumulated by Harry during his service in World War II and his career as a labor organizer and instructor. His early files date from the mid-1940s, and document his time serving in the Army Service Forces at Camp Lee. These files include camp fact sheets, orientation newsletters, training manuals, and bulletins. Harry also wrote articles and presentations related to labor unions and organizing in the late 1950s-early 1960s including an analysis of the Playtex organizing drive and a radio script of a panel discussion he hosted for Wise Potato Chips. A large portion of this series is union organizing-focused fliers, bulletins, and handouts from the 1960s and early 1970s that were distributed by Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America. Some of this print material focused on specific organizing committees for companies including Heinz, Playtex, and Ore-Ida. A plaque for his 1973 retirement and cufflinks and tie clip from Amalgamated are also in this series. Harry also taught instructional courses in the 1980s at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies, and this series contains course manuals for topics including white collar organizing, collective bargaining, and advanced organizing techniques.</p>

          <p>This series contains material related to Mae and Harry's shared interests as a couple and a family. A scrapbook in this series contains clippings, photographs, and ephemera related to Mae and Harry's accomplishments, the Union 211 softball team, City League Teams in Williamsport, PA, and various local and national union rallies and parades. The majority of the material dates from the early 1940s through the 1960s. Travel-related diaries, loose notes, and a collection of hotel stationary date from the 1970s to early 1980s with destinations which include Morocco, the Philippines, Italy, England, Quebec, and Greece. In this series is a small collection of correspondence, as well as assembled files containing memorial service information and obituaries for friends and fellow labor movement supporters. Labor movement-themed song recordings and printed lyrics are in this series, and also a play program and sound recording for <emph render="italic">Needles and Pins</emph>.</p>
