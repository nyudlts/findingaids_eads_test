      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Born October 8, 1841 in Hubbardston, Massachusetts, James Herbert Morse was an author, educator, classical scholar, and literary figure in New York City. After attending Harvard and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1863, Morse then went on to get a Masters of Arts in 1866. Two years later, he founded the Morse and Rogers Classical School in New York City where he taught students Greek and Roman literature and history. Once in New York, Morse became a prominent and active member of various literary and social organizations such as the Century Club, the Greek Club, and the Author's club, among others. In addition to his work as an educator and social figure, he wrote and published various articles, poems, and essays in publications such as Century Magazine, Harper's Monthly,  The Atlantic, and the Anti-Slavery Standard, among others. In 1886, G.P. Putnam's Sons published one volume of his verses, entitled Summer Haven Songs.</p>
