      <p>Frank Gould, a native New Yorker born in 1906, was a prolific playwright and actor throughout his life. This collection, the bulk of which dates from the 1940s, features many of the scripts he wrote for Broadway shows and radio dramas as well as his time in the US Office of War Information Features Division as a writer in the 1940s. Born in Brooklyn, Gould went to Columbia University for college and graduated from the School of Journalism. Soon after, he spent time on the staff of the Brooklyn Eagle, a daily newspaper published from 1841-1955, and the Brooklyn Times-Union, itself bought by Brooklyn Eagle in 1937, before turning to focus on his playwriting and acting. Around this time, he also met and married Ruth Yogendorf Gould on May 30, 1936. </p>
      <p>Working freelance for Himan Brown, an American producer of over 30,000 radio programs, Gould wrote scripts for radio dramas programs such as March of Time, one of the first dramatized radio newsreels - staged and performed like a drama while sharing news content. Gould also wrote for The Columbia Workshop, a program dedicated to entertaining and experimenting with the genre of radio drama. In 1941, he created the program City Desk, a radio drama that followed two detectives as they uncovered murder mysteries, exposed corrupt politics, and pursued romance in the large metropolis. Although uncredited, Gould also wrote the first, seventh, and tenth episode of Inner Sanctum Mystery, a popular radio program mixing horror and humor that aired from 1941-1952 (for which the scripts can be found in the collection). At the same time, Gould performed on Broadway in such productions as "Having Wonderful Time" (1937-1938), and "Escape This Night" (1938), "Cafe Crown" (1942) and wrote plays such as "The Scene of the Crime" (1940).</p>
      <p>Following the entry of the United States into World War Two, Gould became a member of the Features Division in the Office of War Information for the US Army in the North African Theater and was deployed in 1943. He was deployed as a non combatant in the Middle East and spent time in Palestine, Turkey, and Egypt, among other countries. Throughout his time in the army, he created reports on various war fronts and countries and wrote plays about the war, such as "Homage to Bataan". </p>
      <p>After World War Two, Gould returned to writing, notably creating the Broadway show "Tenting Tonight" in 1947 (also referred to as Snow-Job in the collection), which was picked up by a number of theaters. At the same time, he began to write for magazines such as Reader's Digest and True Experience and to insctruct aspiring playwriters at conferences around the country.</p>
