      <p>Housing Works Cannabis Co. (HWCC), a branch of Housing Works, Inc., first opened to the public on December 29, 2022 at 750 Broadway near Astor Place. Through the Seeding Opportunity Initiative, approved by New York Governor Kathy Hochul in March 2022, HWCC received the first Cannabis Adult-Use Retail Dispensaries (CUARD) license in the state. The Seeding Opportunity Initiative seeks to establish socially equitable businesses. Sasha Nutgent, the retail manager of the Broadway store, stated that HWCC operates within a harm reduction framework with a focus on social equity models in their hiring practices and support of those disproportionately affected by cannabis prohibition. Additionally, the CEO of Housing Works, Inc., Charles King, stated at the opening that HWCC would seek to elevate products from LGBTQ+, BIPOC, and women-led cannabis businesses in New York State. As a branch of Housing Works Inc., all proceeds from HWCC go to supporting the company's mission to address both homelessness and HIV/AIDS through advocacy, education, its various services, and its businesses like HWCC that enable such work. Founded in 1990, Housing Works Inc. offers a wide variety of services such as comprehensive housing and healthcare, legal services and advocacy, and a "Ready for Work" program. Both Housing Works Inc. and Housing Works Cannabis Co. aim to uplift communities who have suffered under the war on drugs via their direct action and advocacy.</p>
