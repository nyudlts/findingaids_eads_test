    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Bella Landauer was born Bella Clara Fackenthal in New York in 1874, the only child of a prosperous corset manufacturer. She attended classes at Miss Hewitt's, and became proficient in several foreign languages. Her father disapproved of college for women, so Bella educated herself with her inquiring mind and interest in many different subjects, including opera and theater. In 1900 she married Ian Nathan Landauer, a fabric importer and salesman, and a first-generation immigrant from Germany. The Landauers' sons were born in 1902 and 1906, and Bella devoted her intense energy to the task wife and motherhood. During World War I Mrs. Landauer volunteered for the New York chapter of the American Volunteer Field Service, which took a toll on her health. A doctor ordered her to rest, and Landauer looked to find more suitable activities for herself.</p><p>Bella Landauer first began collecting ephemera in 1923, when she bought a portfolio of bookplates and other prints for one hundred dollars. Though that portfolio was later revealed to have been stolen from a dealer, Landauer was permanently hooked on the idea of collecting printed ephemera. She first embarked on a quest to discover and acquire new bookplates. The next year she added tradecards. Subsequently, as she encountered new genres of material, her interests expanded and her collections grew. She traveled to Europe in search of ephemera, and began to create special collections on specific advertising themes. </p><p>In 1926, when Landauer moved from her brownstone at 11 West 74th Street into an apartment in the Drake Hotel, she no longer had space to house her already quite large collection of ephemera. She offered part of her collection to the New-York Historical Society, initially presenting a group of trade cards and bookplates, but never stopped adding to and expanding the collection. Landauer was first given a former kitchen in which to store and organize her collections. However, when the Society's building was expanded in the late 1930s, a special room was created on the third floor to house the Landauer Collection. </p><p>Landauer was made an Honorary Curator of the collection but was never on the Society's payroll. She spent hours at the Society organizing her various materials, and members of the public were invited to view them on Sunday afternoons. Landauer continued to collect and donate items, including lottery tickets, posters, sheet music, cameo cards, and matchbooks, until her death in 1960. Her son James D. Landauer donated more items to her collections.</p><p>Landauer often referred to her collections as "scraps of old paper," but these ephemeral items have proven to be valuable graphic records of their times. The New-York Historical Society's Bella C. Landauer Collection of Business and Advertising Ephemera holds over eight hundred thousand items. Landauer also donated ephemera to many other institutions: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the New York Public Library, Dartmouth College library, Library of Congress, and Baker Library at Harvard University.</p><p>In 2001, Landauer's reference materials were separated from the ephemera collection material, and became a separate collection, the Bella C. Landauer Reference and Writings Collection (PR 149.) All three-dimensional items (such as milk cartons, matchbooks, and paperweights) were transferred to the New-York Historical Society's Department of Painting, Sculpture, and Decorative Arts.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Bella C. Landauer Collection of Business and Advertising Ephemera contains material spanning the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Collection contains an amazing array of advertising ephemera in a variety of formats: posters, trade cards, cigar labels, product labels, printed advertisements, and sheet music, among others. The collection was originally organized by Landauer, as described above, in a variety of ways, most usually by format or by product being advertised. </p><p>Landauer's own lists of items by subject can be found in the Bella C. Landauer Reference and Writings Collection (PR 149). </p><p>Throughout Series I and II, all ephemera is organized by the product for which it is advertising. This makes searching for specific businesses and industries easy, but searching for examples of specific printers or lithographers more difficult. Researchers are encouraged to contact the Print Room reference staff at printroom@nyhistory.org for assistance.</p>  </scopecontent>

Within the scrapbooks, there is rarely any further refinement of organization; a researcher looking for a specific business or product may need to consult each of the 4 or 5 scrapbooks compiled on the subject in order to complete an exhaustive search. In some cases, Landauer's own lists (in PR 149) may be of use, but so much of the material has been moved around since Landauer's time that those lists may not be of more help than exhaustively searching.</p><p>In addition to the scrapbooks she compiled, filled with pasted and taped-in small paper ephemera, Landauer collected scrapbooks that had been compiled by others. These are of various sizes and subjects and are filed at the end of the series, with brief descriptions found in the box and folder list. Some additional scrapbooks of ephemera, acquired by the N-YHS after Landauer's death, have been added to this set.</p><p>The following is a list of subject headings, under which material is filed. Each topic may have several scrapbooks. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref17_60x" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>ADVERTISING</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_79108feda806ff26a00c1c46d6dc3fd6"

Most items in this series were once housed inside the scrapbooks, and were removed for preservation or exhibition reasons. Additional material has been added to these files since Landauer's death; it is no longer easy to know what ephemera items originated in Landauer's own collection. Some items have roman numerals written on the verso in pencil - these numbers correspond to Landauer's original scrapbook numbers and are written in her hand. Other material may have one of several stamps that Landauer used to identify her collection.</p><p>Within the general scrapbook-based subject organization, files have been further broken down by type of product, manufacturer, or geographical location where appropriate. </p><p>For ease of access, and to best utilize Landauer's filing system, all loose ephemera (i.e. not pasted in a scrapbook) not found in Series III-VII is housed in Series II. This series is organized into subseries by size.  Researchers are advised to consult all three subseries in search of their topics of interest.</p><p>Subseries I: Small Ephemera (usually less than 9 x 12 inches) is housed upright in file boxes. </p><p>Subseries II: Medium Ephemera (between 9 x 12 inches and 14 x 18 inches) is housed flat in boxes. Some material in this subseries was originally pasted into scrapbooks. </p><p>Subseries III: Large Ephemera is housed in flat files.  Most of this material had previously been called (by Landauer and N-YHS staff) "posters." </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_2c1bc1d4961a922e65a532c95377a557" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries I: SMALL EPHEMERA</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_9c96509dc0149b951d0fc4ef11ae9aaf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advertising</unittitle><container id="aspace_a84f2e925e6fd1fa6d92eae253741b0f" label="Mixed Materials [1804000029811]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_166409d85273874e75029e9d99c2ec63"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>includes material from BCL scrapbook 01</p><p>Signs and sign companies</p><p>Trading stamp books</p><p>Miscellaneous</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7567da0bd20de0ed5a5892b2a3e51285" level="file"><did><unittitle>Agriculture</unittitle><container id="aspace_e2a2637ca717ebac0e6ade6f5215eb01" label="Mixed Materials [1804000029812]" type="Offsite-Box">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f9f36f160efdb85a3ef3f05e06339fe3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes material from BCL scrapbooks 01 D and E

MUSIC</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_18b382c601daf589c88bb356994fd3ff"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Landauer kept her sheet music separate from other printed ephemera, and it can be found here. This series is arranged by the general subject of the music's cover illustration.  The sheet music is not arranged based on what the song is about. However, some music that does not have a cover illustration is filed under the subject of the song along with those songs with illustrations of the same subject. Subjects generally follow the themes of Landauer's scrapbooks (from which some of this music was removed) but are also taken from other collections of sheet music and from the Thesaurus for Graphic Materials subject headings.</p><p>A database on site allows for searching by title or composer.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref74_eoo" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>ANIMALS</unittitle></did><c

Also included are cigar bands, matchbook covers, newspaper clippings, and pieces of correspondence between Weichsel and the various agents from whom he procured either packaging or information about tobacco production and distribution in the various countries. The packaging is largely undated, and though there are pieces from the nineteenth century, most of the pieces appear to be mid-twentieth century, contemporary with Weichsel's collecting in the 1950s.</p><p>It is currently unclear whether Landauer herself acquired this collection before her death (as she often did) or if it was donated to the Society at a later date. Because of the ambiguity of the historical record, it has been kept within the confines of the Landauer collection.</p><p>The bulk of the collection is material from international tobacco companies.

materials related to the Army-Navy "E" Award, or the Excellence in War Production Award. The Army Navy "E" Award was an honor presented to top performers of the civilian war industry during World War II. It was only given to about 4 percent of the homefront industry during the wartime years. </p><p>The "E" Awards program began in July 1942, and was meant to encourage production of materials needed for the United States'complete military mobilization effort. The award consisted of a pennant for the plant and pins for all employees. The pennant was triangular swallowtail with a white border, with a capital E within a yellow wreath of oak and laurel leaves on a vertical divided blue and red background. ARMY is on the red background and NAVY on the blue background. </p><p>The presentation of the E Award was made in a formal ceremony that was preceded by issuance of printed invitations and programs. These programs, from a wide array of companies and industries across the United States, make up the bulk of this series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_9fcdb50559dc6d71eeed1b3452f7c8aa"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Material is arranged alphabetically by company name.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_d329c28ce599dc02a0690a13a1d7cfbf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies A-B</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_1c58c324939d8cba2e4a50829b9a3959" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018026]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ee75640f147364776b1c5870a1f9cdb3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies C-D</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_55a8b1b68ea5ea4919a4ff824dba9579" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018027]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6f97e89328f0a132f121be9eae3535fc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies E-F</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_965621da76eb0332950fd4e2d5bd4d3a" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018028]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a922e86dd66aa9c3940593ee14a5b60c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies G-I</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_ce7bdff590be45b326d50f720f5fb861" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018029]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b82f04c67ab1446ff70ec00cd11457ad" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies J-L</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_4a571f7f40701f19c3fcf9079b40554b" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018030]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e22b291194510b1a687fc1e1feffb91f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies M-N</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_4353520c5fe160fceae80a3770179a6e" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018031]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_36d79a05bb292ef650fa574667da680a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies O-R</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_2341dd4c657dcf60c5d77d7a95b485da" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018032]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ec92bb70fe785e1e8788cdf0710259e9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies S-T</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_32b2b6507c02e8d5624a3a27b69b29e0" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018033]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f336f4a741c42305af382fd769e6851a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Companies U-Z</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_5d4587547e6e210211e80eda4cc212cd" label="Mixed Materials [10170000018034]" type="Offsite-Box">VIII.9</container></did></c></c></dsc>
