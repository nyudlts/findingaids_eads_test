    <abstract id="aspace_9d7614cecbefddc6a33cf60ede7ac833">The collection includes over 3200 color photographs, primarily in digital form, taken by photographer Stephen Harmon (1943-) of New York City's buildings from brownstones to skyscrapers, storefronts, parks, people, and street life in the 1970s-2017. Especially well-represented in the collection are images of Times Square of the 1970s, Manhattan's Upper West Side, Central Park, Greenwich Village, the New York subway transit system and the passengers who ride the city's trains, and the city's street life from quiet side streets to traffic and pedestrian congested avenues. Additional images will continue to be added to the collection.</abstract>

The first eight series, designated with the prefix "D," are digital content and are organized broadly by topics that generally, and at points explicitly, follow Stephen Harmon's categorizations. The tenth series, designated with the prefix "P," includes photographic prints of various forms and subjects.</p><p>Series D.I. "Old Times Square" (1980s-1990s)</p><p>Series D.II. New York City Buildings, Parks and Other Cityscapes, prior to 2002 (1970s-2001)</p><p>Series D.III. New York City Buildings, Parks and Other Cityscapes, 2002 and later (2002-2017)</p><p>Series D.IV.

<lb/> <lb/></p><p><emph render="bold">ORGANIZATION OF THE DIGITAL FILES</emph></p><p>The digital files reflected in this finding aid were received by N-YHS in over 525 emails sent over the course of several years, from 2012-2017. Further, over 1000 emails and other transmissions received later have not yet been processed and will be added to the finding aid in the future. In part for this reason, the digital files are named, organized and stored in a chronological order (generally using date received) and not in accordance with the above series. For patrons requesting and receiving specific files, this difference will not matter. However, it will matter for patrons working more generally or with the entirety of the collection as they will need to use the chronological "digital folder" identifier, which uses a YYYYMMDD format, from the finding aid to navigate through the collection to locate specific images. The N-YHS Reference Librarian can provide any further guidance as needed.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Stephen F. (Steve) Harmon is a now-retired attorney formerly of the Manhattan law firm Troutman Sanders and, most relevant for this collection, a lifelong photographer. Harmon was born in Brooklyn in 1943 and grew up in Queens. He graduated in 1964 with a B.A. from Queens College of the City University of New York and in 1967 with a LL.B from Brooklyn Law School. After residing for a time on Long Island, Harmon moved with his family back to New York City in 1978, living on the Upper West Side where he still resides with his wife, Cynthia. By the early 1980s, Harmon was a member of the SoHo Photo Gallery and exhibiting his work there and at other venues. His work is held by the Brooklyn Museum, Museum of the City of New York, New York Public Library, and other cultural and corporate collections in addition to the New-York Historical Society.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The processing of Harmon's digital photographs have a complicated history. From 2012-July 2017, about 2900 photos were received from Harmon in about 450 emails directed to the curator of photographs' N-YHS Gmail account. A few of these, mostly from 2013, were downloaded to an N-YHS server, while the others remained in Gmail. In June 2017, a new Gmail account was created by N-YHS and all emails from 2012 and 2014-July 2017 were forwarded by the curator to this new account. From that account, in June-July 2017, intern Anna Baccaglini downloaded the photos and made PDFs of the emails, saving them to N-YHS's server. No further processing was done at that time. Harmon continued to send emails to the curator, who forwarded them to the new Gmail account. This continued until February 2020 when a new delivery mechanism was implemented.</p><p>In late 2020, processing of the digital files began on a piecemeal basis and is continuing. As of February 2021, processing was completed for emails/files received through October 2017, which included those previously downloaded by Anna Baccaglini and some additional files. These were organized and described by archivist Larry Weimer in this finding aid and transferred to permanent digital storage by digital archivist Margo Padilla. As additional files are processed this finding aid will be updated.</p><p>As a general matter, processing of the individual emails/images received from Harmon included the following steps: Downloading of the photographs from each email to storage; saving the emails as PDFs; changing default camera-generated filenames to filenames that maintained the relationship between the photographs and their related, contextualizing email; and describing each email/photos (or related set of emails/photos) within the appropriate series of the finding aid, with a digital identifier for access. Duplicate images were removed.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes color photographs of New York City, primarily in digital format, taken by Stephen Harmon in the 1970s to 2017. (Many photographs in digital formats from this time period and later remain unprocessed, and will be added to the finding aid over time.) The photographs tend to center on either the built environment of the city or the people who interact with the city and its built environment on a daily basis, though there is overlap between these categories. A particularly good example of this overlap in the collection is the series of "subway life" photographs, which include images of New York City's subway trains, stations, and the passengers who use them, often as an essential element of their urban lives and livelihoods. </p><p>Harmon's earliest photographs date from the 1970s-1980s and include images of Times Square, the World Trade Center, and people and fashions of the time. The latest photographs date into the 2010s, and include the Santiago Calatrava-designed Oculus at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the Gay Pride Parade of 2015, and many others. Ranging across these decades, and especially well-represented in the photographs, are images of Manhattan's Upper West Side, Central Park, and Greenwich Village, as well as many other areas of New York City. Manhattan predominates the collection, but Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx also appear.</p><p>Harmon transmitted the digital photographs, which comprise the bulk of the collection, via email over a period of 8 years, from his RCN webmail account to a New-York Historical Society Gmail account. The digital photographs are in JPG format, both born-digital and digitized by Harmon from original physical formats. Digital photographs were either attached to or embedded in his email messages and downloaded individually to local storage. Harmon's emails often included essential context for the digital photos that frequently went well beyond basic facts like date or building name to include backstory, commentary about the subject, humorous captioning, artistic intent and focus, and other deeper context. Accordingly, with only a few exceptions, the contextual emails were saved as PDFs and are included in the collection with the digital photographs.</p>  </scopecontent>

Within Manhattan, areas that figure prominently include Central Park, the Upper West Side, 125th Street, Midtown, Greenwich Village, and Chinatown. The views are primarily exteriors of buildings, storefronts, parks, street views, and street traffic. These views range from close details, such as signage, shop displays, and doorways, to broad vistas of the skyline as seen down avenues, across the East River, or from bridges. Interior views of buildings are much less common in the series and their occurrence are typically noted in the container list. The specific scope of the series and the determination of which photos to include in it was made by the processing archivist.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_cfa7b9cd7533cab7b470709b1752299f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged in rough chronological order by the date of the photographs.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_8fab3fe520ef4dfd53ad0b5c69bd5e41" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lower Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn Bridge, from FDR Drive (1 photo + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2002 February</unitdate><container id="aspace_43777b4dc739f05daa5c9e69730174da" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20171024</container><container id="aspace_e4c94511aa903294173b05f6169e3531" parent="aspace_43777b4dc739f05daa5c9e69730174da" type="Digital File">2_1,  email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b11399c4e72df4bb8357c73eff9cca87" level="file"><did><unittitle>Coney Island building at Surf and 12th Street, closed for winter (1 photo + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2002 February</unitdate><container id="aspace_ec91d278335c46d48a0f0e03cd9d56b3" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20171018</container><container id="aspace_a62dc7a7ec8924f2788500fb780102f3" parent="aspace_ec91d278335c46d48a0f0e03cd9d56b3" type="Digital File">4_1,  email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6c7b5e394788015efe92d83191d5ca93" level="file"><did><unittitle>Firehouse.

As Harmon described these in his initial email, the photographs were "made of people I observed or directly confronted from about 1978 to 1985" in order to capture the distinctive look of the period. The series uses the title "Street Portraits" given to the photographs by Harmon, though he also often referred to the series in his emails as "Street People." That title was not used here as that term is commonly used to refer to homeless or other individuals who live on the streets. Although there do appear to be such individuals in the series, there is a greater variety of people in these photographs. </p><p>The series includes portraits of a wide range of individuals and groups. These include the elderly, middle-aged, youths, and children; men and women; and various ethnicities. There are portraits of individuals, couples, and small groups. Many photos focus tightly on the face/head of the subject, while others are taken from a distance. Some focus on particular articles of clothing, such as torn ankle socks, or parts of a body, such as a tattooed arm. Many of the subjects are aware of the photographer and provide varied reactions, from smiles to belligerent glares. On the other hand, many photographs are candid shots.</p><p>Some of the photographs depict people as they conduct their labor on the street, such as mailmen, bus drivers, musicians,and vendors. Some are tender, such as those of affectionate couples, or poignant, such as those of elderly couples supporting each other, or playful, such as the child in the spray of a fire hydrant. Most simply capture people as they engage with their life routines: standing at crosswalks, walking along sidewalks, sitting on park benches and stoops, reading newspapers at bus stops, or using telephone booths, and conversing with one another. Most of the shots are in outdoor/exterior spaces, but a few, usually taken from the sidewalk and through the storefront window, depict diners, barber shop patrons, and others.</p><p>The diversity of clothing features prominently in the series. It ranges from conventional suits and ties to tattered apparel to the punk look of the era to various fashions, including hair styles, and casual streetwear. The photographs were taken in various seasons so the portraits range from the loosely-dressed look of the summer to the bundled overcoats of winter.  </p><p>Although the photographs are generally not associated with a very specific location, they are all from New York and likely from the Upper West Side/Central Park area through Midtown to Greenwich Village for the most part. The cityscape provides a backdrop to many of the photographs, including newstands, food carts, storefronts, parked and moving cars, taxis, and nondescript buildings. All in all, the photos capture a sense of the demographic diversity found day to day on the streets of Manhattan, and the particular look of that diversity in that period.</p><p>Because of the consistency of the overall theme of the series, the individual emails generally include little or no additional context to the photographs, but there are a few exceptions to this.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_933ea6771b463736b05c6e115bdad633"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged in the order in which the emails transmitting the photographs were

Unlike the earlier series, though, which tended to focus more tightly on "portraits" of individuals or couples/small groups, the "street show" series, to use a term Harmon often used in categorizing some of these images, tend to capture individuals in the context of some activity. These range from the quotodian, such as people waiting at a bus stop or children eating pizza, to the slapstick, such as a person slipping on ice, to the desperate, such as panhandling. Also unlike the content of Street Portraits, which was defined entirely by the photographer, this series includes both those images referred to as part of New York's "street show" by Harmon and similar images identified by the processing archivist. The container list descriptions were typically composed by the processing archivist in order to convey the literal content of the image; Harmon's email, preserved with the image, often includes his humorous captioning, his particular points of emphasis in the image, or other commentary.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e8a456709f17b16adb70d6d63d7908e6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged in chronological order by the date of the photographs.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_706fa1181bfbf0151c665a5d60e25ee3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Busker with sign "Tell me off for $1.00" (1 photo + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_f5ace57d529518c3930b569412f4fffe" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20170403</container><container id="aspace_e38ca356b55be997bf52cdb272000987" parent="aspace_f5ace57d529518c3930b569412f4fffe" type="Digital File">1_1, email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_29a73aaf2ed79a6849ede24066c4d232" level="file"><did><unittitle>Woman and child at apartment window in Chinatown (1 photo + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1981 December</unitdate><container id="aspace_c16bffbd7c0d65e473c6375d99553cb3" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20171016</container><container id="aspace_2f47083a4dbf64331e5e6d2fce345054" parent="aspace_c16bffbd7c0d65e473c6375d99553cb3" type="Digital File">1_1,  email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b47757b5c683f55ee1764307c3396305" level="file"><did><unittitle>Panhandlers at car windows (1 photo + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1995</unitdate><container id="aspace_23133f3eb4dd70e5f979c36895165b25" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20170616</container><container id="aspace_30a874a7f87aa3bcf0eaf19548f044fa" parent="aspace_23133f3eb4dd70e5f979c36895165b25" type="Digital File">2_1, email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_bd6c91a6b08af9b92a386ce85dc1d38f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Woman getting a shoe shine on the street (1 photo + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1998 January</unitdate><container id="aspace_1ed95a3b40f3e98d24af0943e769f098" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20171020</container><container id="aspace_3dccc0a9e882859175866c45d77f63b7" parent="aspace_1ed95a3b40f3e98d24af0943e769f098" type="Digital File">2_1,  email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9e63e9baa0cf2572e8f98c245130a511" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hasidic Jews in Williamsburg (2 photos + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">circa 2000</unitdate><container id="aspace_c70d836b535d8344ce5419dd8689faa5" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20170814</container><container id="aspace_57b704487143da6cb8ea2ade1cb9873e" parent="aspace_c70d836b535d8344ce5419dd8689faa5" type="Digital File">3_1-2,  email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_4f7bb61e0f26ca65f3c08fc55e159e16" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pedestrians in SoHo (1 photo + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2004 September</unitdate><container id="aspace_2af6bd2fb78cc07f9a7dc7f63713cde3" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20170202</container><container id="aspace_4fef6d8e24fde1b2384bc7bcca9cc64f" parent="aspace_2af6bd2fb78cc07f9a7dc7f63713cde3" type="Digital File">2_1, email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_73cba7980d160b5d0c743dd5a3644fe0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chess players, Washington Square Park (3 photos + 1 email)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2006 October</unitdate><container id="aspace_41292ec7eaad29756f8d455c6766bf51" label="Graphic Materials" type="Digital Folder">20170514</container><container id="aspace_8fd976c3c44d25ac4ea46ed590cd88db" parent="aspace_41292ec7eaad29756f8d455c6766bf51" type="Digital File">4_1-3, email</container></did></c><c id="aspace_bfce39999fd96a66419bf6f0688749a9" level="file"><did><unittitle>People waiting at bus stop.

These images include people within the train cars and on station platforms. There are also many photos not centered on people, including images of signage, turnstiles, train exteriors, ticket booths, and other infrastructure. </p><p>Generally, the series holds images taken from within the transit system, not from outside it. Accordingly, most of the images are interior views, with few street level views. Street level views of stations and the like can more commonly be found in Series D.II and D.III (Buildings, Parks, Cityscapes). In the container list below, "interior" refers to images taken inside of train coaches; "station" refers to both platforms and to areas of the station and network of connecting tunnels leading to the platforms; and "passengers" refers to people anywhere in the system.</p><p>The general concept of the series was defined by Steve Harmon and he often, but not always, identified photographs that he considered part of it. Photographs not so identified by Harmon but clearly consistent with the theme were included by the processing archivist.</p></scopecontent><arrangement
