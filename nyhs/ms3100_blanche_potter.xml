    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Blanche Potter was born in New York City on January 2, 1864. She was the daughter of wealthy New York businessman, real estate developer and politician Orlando B. Potter (1823-1894) and his wife, Martha Green Wiley Potter (1822-1879). Orlando Potter died intestate and his estate was divided among his four children, including his 600 acre farm in Ossining, a portion of which was inherited by Blanche. </p><p>Blanche was a philanthropist and at least from 1910, and possibly before, she was engaged in various causes, especially those concerning health and welfare. Among other positions, from 1910 until her death she was a member of the board of Bellevue Hospital's Training School for Nurses, and from 1910 to 1927 she was Chair of the auxiliary of Bellevue's Tuberculosis Division.</p><p>Blanche lived for thirty years with another woman, Emma Louise Christie (who seems to have used Louise as her call name), which is suggestive of a possibly gay relationship. Christie was born September 1, 1869, at Haverstraw, New York. She became a Registered Nurse (R.N.), graduating from the Bellevue Training School in 1894. In 1907, according to Christie's brief obituary in the New York Times, which seems likely to have been written by Potter, she "became the beloved friend and constant companion of Miss Blanche Potter, with whom until her death, she made her home at 45 Park Ave., New York City." </p><p>For the last thirty years of Christie's life, she and Potter lived together in New York City and at Potter's country home in Ossining. They also traveled widely together, along with other women, as documented in this collection of Potter's travel journals and photograph albums.</p><p>In 1937, Louise Christie died while on a visit to her family home in Thiells, in Haverstraw, NY. Potter sold her home in Ossining shortly afterward. Potter died on October 5, 1942, and is buried with her parents and sisters in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery.</p><p>[The above note is based on notes provided by the dealer from whom the collection was acquired (a copy of the notes is included in the first box of the collection) and the obituaries in the New York Times of Blanche Potter (October 6, 1942) and E. Louise Christie (July 5, 1937).]</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The collection was processed by archivist Larry Weimer in 2022.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection holds 26 photograph albums and 4 journals compiled and written by Blanche Potter. All relate to Potter's travels in the United States and abroad from 1904-1939, taken with her life companion, Louise Christie, and/or other women. The photograph albums hold about 3,400 sepia-toned snapshots of historic sites, local peoples, travel accommodations, landscapes, and various points of interest in Europe, northern Africa, India, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Canada, and the United States. Potter, Christie and their traveling companions are in many of the photos.</p><p>The photographs are captioned. Though most of the photos were likely taken by Potter, not all were, as indicated by many caption's reference to "taken by" and crediting another person by name or initial. The albums are dated with at least an opening date on the inside cover. They were all numbered by Potter, though the collection seems not to have all the albums she ever compiled as those in the collection start with number 20 and end with number 65, with gaps.</p><p>Some of the photograph albums include local New York State travel and scenes from visits to Potter and her sibling's country homes in Ossining. Visits to her father's roots in Charlemont, Massachusetts, are also pictured.</p><p>Providing rich context to some of the photo albums are the 4 travel journals in the collection, which take the form of either letters written to friends or of diary entries. These journals relate to Potter and her companions' travels in Europe (1904; albums 20-22); in, primarily, Italy and Egypt (1911; albums 31-35); eastern Canada, especially Nova Scotia (1923; album 52); and Central and South America (1924; albums 53-55). The journals also include many additional photographs for illustration.</p><p>The container list includes reference to each of the volumes in the collection, with a fuller description of each volume. That description was taken primarily from the description provided by the dealer from which N-YHS acquired the volumes. </p>  </scopecontent>

This volume, like the [1904 volume], is a series of letters written by Potter, but they are not addressed to anyone in particular, and are written in more of a 'journal' format....Potter's partner, Louise Christie, is on the trip with Potter....The volume contains a series of 18 letters written by Potter that documents her and her party's extensive travels mainly through Italy and Egypt, with some travel in France. The photograph album volumes numbered 31-35 further documents this trip."</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6de7ae9bf421e2ead17286d6f63b879c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photograph album #31</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1911 January-February</unitdate><container id="aspace_9595607e0ebbe06948b4552c2c05c513" label="Mixed Materials [1804000036592]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container id="aspace_86240d480531d6e7398cc395b6088845" parent="aspace_9595607e0ebbe06948b4552c2c05c513" type="Folder">8</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ed0866e3c4ff43b2717327885106b208"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>From the dealer's notes: "149 photos, includes photos of Gibraltar, Algiers, Tunisia; Monte Carlo; Monaco; Island of Elba; Abbas, Alexandria, Cairo, Luxor, Thebes, in Egypt visiting the Pyramids, Sphinx, Temples at Karnack and Philae, etc., sailing on the Nile; amongst other places."</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bbe691c8de921b8bc7a843f6edae89db" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photograph album #32</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1911 February-March</unitdate><container id="aspace_0eb3cedb7f4e911eb31f20e74202b3ba" label="Mixed Materials [1804000036592]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container id="aspace_3c6e6c89c76d63dec7e1a94e9beb0043" parent="aspace_0eb3cedb7f4e911eb31f20e74202b3ba" type="Folder">9</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_361763f7c2b9a2a2c8f6bbcfd64d3696"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>From the dealer's notes: "133 photos, includes photos of Temple of Philae, Aswan Dam, Camel Race Track at Heliopolos, Egypt; Athens, Corfu, Corinth, Greece, views of the Acropolis, the Arch of Hadrian, Parthenon, other historic sights, etc; Messina, Monreale, Mt.
