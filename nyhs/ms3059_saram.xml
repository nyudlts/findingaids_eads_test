    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Carole De Saram is both the former Chair of Community Board 1 (CB#1) in Manhattan and the former President of the Tribeca Community Association (TCA). Active in the Tribeca community for over 40 years, De Saram witnessed and shaped the development of this historical area. She was also influential in the feminist movement and is the former president of the New York City chapter of the National Women's Organization (NOW). An interview with Carole De Saram was conducted by The New York Preservation Archive Project, which can be found <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.nypap.org/oral-history/carole-de-saram/">here</extref>. </p><p>
In the 1970s, many artists moved into Tribeca's large and inexpensive lofts, creating a progressive community in a mostly industrial section of Manhattan and stimulating desirability. Around this time, the name Tribeca was coined for the "Triangle below Canal" Street, previously known as Washington Square Market. De Saram became involved with CB#1 and the TCA and helped organize the process of designating Tribeca as a landmark historic district in the 1980s. The area was split into four separate landmark districts: Tribeca North, East, South and West. De Saram felt strongly about issues that affected quality of life for Tribeca residents. These ranged from environmental concerns, noise and light pollution, open space initiatives, and safety considerations. Development in Tribeca saw a tremendous boom starting in the 1980s. De Saram paid careful attention to zoning laws and changes, strategizing legal action when CB#1 and the TCA felt building preservation and community well-being were threatened by developers.  </p>  </bioghist>

The topical subject headings listed on this document, reflecting her organizational schema, were retained for the Subject File subheadings. 
These subheadings are:<lb/> <lb/>Landmarks Designation Research and Issues<lb/> <lb/>TCA / NYC Zoning Changes and Battles<lb/> <lb/>416-424 Washington Street<lb/> <lb/>Tribeca Community Association Developer and Zoning Lawsuits<lb/> <lb/>Shearson - American Express - City Planning Council Rezoning of Washington Market<lb/> <lb/>Lower Manhattan Tribeca Reports and Plans<lb/> <lb/>Traffic Studies, Sanitation Garage &amp; Salt Facility, and Realize Hudson Rise Alternative Plan<lb/> <lb/>Hudson River and Route 9A Development<lb/> <lb/>Tribeca Community Association Quality of Life Issues – Lawsuits<lb/> <lb/>Tribeca Parks Founded by Community<lb/> <lb/>Texture of Tribeca Book<lb/> <lb/> Tribeca Community Association (TCA) Papers</p><p>
The files within each Series I subheading have been arranged by roughly descending bulk order, so that the files with the most material appear first within each subheading. The materials were received in labeled folders, often with notes about the contents written on the folder. These original notes are transcribed within the file's scope and contents note when they supplied information supplementary to the title. The folders are not archival, but have been retained since they are annotated by the creator. The original folders along with their contents were rehoused in archival folders as a precautionary measure against acid migration. As another preservation measure, the newsprint in each folder has been enclosed within archival paper slings to prevent it from damaging surrounding papers.</p><p>At the close of the series is a set of photographs received separately from the main body of the documents.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_a0e504673322da7ca37ef729de791d0c" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="bold">Landmarks Designation Research and Issues:</emph></unittitle><container id="aspace_5cbb989fb49fc8127b9188450e16676a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">-</container><container id="aspace_85c9e2632f3e6e939cce220ffb54a94b" parent="aspace_5cbb989fb49fc8127b9188450e16676a" type="Folder">-</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ff860a0022dc636cb32f2c765aba1bf2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Landmarks Designation</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1984-2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_d56668efc5f067e7a2a3df53af2dc86a" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7857]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container id="aspace_91412501480a7aa709ce589da19fb52d" parent="aspace_d56668efc5f067e7a2a3df53af2dc86a" type="Folder">1-8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a464957d573e7eb00e7804b9ac64e662" level="file"><did><unittitle>LPC Buildings Department Forms</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1984-1986</unitdate><container id="aspace_28859d9028d3084350dba157e113dedd" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7857]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container id="aspace_f68356f8b4e2f5cdd147c92f804ff16b" parent="aspace_28859d9028d3084350dba157e113dedd" type="Folder">9-12</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4d96b36e087510f58c209dbb3d8d9b3d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Original folder reads: "Landmark Survey Forms - Data obtained from Municipal Archive files for Landmark Commission to designate Tribeca an historic district.

Some residences were designed for the Ramirez family and others were designated for rental units. Ramirez had to obtain a zoning variance approval from the BSA for the planned nine story structure because the lot was only zoned for six stories. Community Board # 1, the Tribeca Community Association, and many Tribeca neighbors opposed the height of this building, feeling it would block views from nearby residences and clash with the character of the neighborhood. They also took issue with how a hardship variance could be granted for the construction of four luxury condominiums, two of which would be for the personal use of the Ramirez family. In the end, Ramirez was granted variance approval from the BSA and the building designed by his hired architect, Morris Adjmi, was completed in 2008.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c18042349f18f2fcc0ed793889833e6c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Board of Standards and Appeals / Ramirez Project</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">2004-2005</unitdate><container id="aspace_fadb088216033f1fcede47c88fa0f9ba" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7859]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container id="aspace_0b96a21bebcc3ab67fb22a7f1af3e5e0" parent="aspace_fadb088216033f1fcede47c88fa0f9ba" type="Folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a49b16080e94062f429a5ab38e45f078"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In 2004, the TCA et al. brought a case to the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of New York, against the NYC BSA and Ramirez Properties, LLC, to vacate, set aside, and annul the approval of the BSA zoning variance to Ramirez Properties which allowed the construction of a nine story structure at 408 Greenwich Street.
