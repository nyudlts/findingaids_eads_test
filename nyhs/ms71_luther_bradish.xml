    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Luther Bradish was a prominent 19th century American lawyer and politician. Bradish was born on September 15, 1783 in Cummington, Massachusetts. Bradish graduated from Williams College in 1804. He studied law, passed the bar, and became an attorney. During the War of 1812, Bradish served in the U.S. Army. In 1814, he married Elizabeth Gibbs, daughter of the mineralogist George Gibbs, however, the marriage was short lived as Elizabeth gave birth to a stillborn child and died in childbirth in 1816. Bradish married Mary Eliza Hart in 1839 and they had a daughter together. </p><p><lb/>In 1819, President James Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams recruited Bradish to negotiate a commerce and shipping treaty with the Ottoman Empire, however, this  treaty with the Ottomans was not ratified until May 1830 under the presidency of Andrew Jackson. In addition to visiting the Ottomans in Turkey, Bradish also spent time exploring the European continent.</p><p><lb/>After returning from Europe, Luther Bradish moved to Moira, NY in 1826. He purchased several tracts of land and became a major proprietor in the town. While residing in Moira, Bradish was elected to the New York State Assembly as a representative for Franklin County. He served in the Assembly from 1827 to 1830 and again from 1836 to 1838. During his second term, he was elected as Speaker of the House. </p><p><lb/>Bradish was a member of the Whig Party and between 1839 and 1842, he spent two terms as Lieutenant Governor of New York, working with his Whig colleague, Governor William H. Seward. Bradish was a supporter of the abolition of slavery and during his campaign for the Lieutenant Governor position, he received support from the abolitionist community. In 1842 he ran for Governor, but was defeated by Democrat, William C. Bouck. Under the Presidency of Millard Fillmore in 1855, Bradish briefly served as Assistant United States Treasurer. </p><p><lb/>During his lifetime, Luther Bradish was affiliated with several organizations and institutions. He was on the Board of Trustees of the Franklin Academy and the University of the City of New York. He was also President of the New-York Historical Society from 1850 until his death and the American Bible Society from 1862 until his death. </p><p><lb/>Bradish was also a supporter of science, technology, and modernization. He was actively involved in building new roads within New York State, as well as canals and railroads. He was a member of the American Agricultural Society and the American Geographical and Statistical Society. In 1859, Bradish pushed for the establishment of an astronomical observatory in Central Park. </p><p><lb/>Luther Bradish died of typhoid dysentery on August 30, 1863 in Newport, Rhode Island. His body was returned to New York and he is buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. </p>  </bioghist>

<p>This collection is arranged chronologically and placed into fifteen document size boxes, as well as three half-document size boxes. Some items have been placed in two oversize folders. Although the majority of the collection is chronological, the latter part of the collection consists of undated material.</p><p><lb/>It should be noted that some documents had been previously processed, removed, and placed into separate boxes.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At some point, likely in the late twentieth century, this collection was processed and re-housed into archival boxes and folders. Some of the correspondence was separated and a basic catalog was prepared, centering on the separated items. The original order of the Luther Bradish papers is unknown. </p><p><lb/>During the summer of 2019, the collection was re-processed and re-organized by archival intern, Aki Snyder. Documents that were previously separated were reincorporated into the larger collection, and a full finding aid prepared. </p>  </processinfo>
