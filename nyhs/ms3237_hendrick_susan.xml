<p>The Hendrick Institute Boarding and Day School for Young Ladies and Delicate Children, founded by Susan L. Hendrick circa 1875, aimed to educate and empower "young ladies" and "delicate children" by integrating health and physical exercise with more traditional instruction in grammar, arithmetics, and other subjects. </p><p>Little is to be found about Susan L. Hendrick, but the dealer identifies her as a "woman with feminist leanings, activities, and goals of late 19th century modernity" as well as practitioner of the Physical Culture, or Body Culture, movement. As evidenced by the goals of the Hendrick Institute, Hendrick, as an individual and educator, was an avid proponent of this fitness and strength training movement. Originating in Germany and the United Kingdom, before spreading to the United States with the arrival of German immigrants after 1848, Physical Culture feared that white collars workers were suffering from "diseases of affluence" given their sedentary lifestyles and so developed exercise regimens to combat these lifestyles, drawing from dances, folk games, existing sports, and military training. Subsequently, the movement was promoted in educational systems, such as the Hendrick Institute, but mainly in military academies.</p><p>The Hendrick Institute, itself located at 25 West 26th Street, advertised the charm of the school's locale – "one of the most desirable and delightful parts of the city directly opposite Reservoir Park" – as equally important to the school's vision of young women's roles as strong, healthy women and to show that, even in the city and among the affluent and sedentary, "physiological knowledge"  could be as paramount to educating a child as other forms of knowledge. Ultimately, the goal was to recognize health as the basis of power and resilience and build such bodily power in their students. Susan L. Hendrick organized the school to think critically and carefully about the role of health in wider society and the methods in which exercise and physiological knowledge could be taught to young ladies and delicate children, ranging from sports classes to the newest exercise equipment and machines. As a part of curriculum, the institute's core courses always featured grammar lessons from Whitley's Elements of English Grammar, "Dancing, Gymnastics, and Vocal Exercises," among others.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The materials in this collection document Susan L. Hendrick's work founding the Hendrick Institute Boarding and Day School for Young Ladies and Delicate Children. Mostly written on lined sheets from a logbook, the materials consist of compositions and essays written by Hendrick as she outlined the vision and mission of the school. There are many rounds of drafts written to carefully define the language used to describe the school, its location, and its pupils; musings on the role of health, exercise, and the proper sports; and practical exercises for pupils to ameliorate their grammar and handwriting.</p>  </scopecontent>
