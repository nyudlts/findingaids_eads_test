<p>The NYU Abu Dhabi University Archives Campus Poster Collection has been compiled by NYU Abu Dhabi Archives and Special Collections staff from a variety of sources. The collection consists of posters and flyers publicizing various campus events, such as lectures, performances, exhibitions, cultural evenings, campaigns, and other activities in the community. Dates of these posters start from 2010, and cover some earlier years of the institution, but the majority are from the Saadiyat Campus period, and specifically from 2019-present. 

The collection is arranged into two series. 

Series 1 is an accummulating collection of posters gathered by Archives and Special Collections staff during routine walks of the campus. Materials have been collected from bulletin boards, elevators, and other spaces of promotion as activities have ended. Arranged chronologically by academic years and semesters within, this series aims to provide a snapshot of campus life activities each semester.

Series 2 is a collection of Student Interest Group (SIG) and Student Activities events announcements, digitally downloaded by Archives and Special Collections Student Assistants from various spaces of student communication and exchange, such as Facebook groups, and the OrgSync and Engage platforms. This series is arranged alphabetically by SIG or Student Program.</p>  </scopecontent>
