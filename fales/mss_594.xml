    <abstract id="aspace_158798acae6ce2d31c952a00b2050895">Jack Doroshow (1939-2017), also known as the drag queen Flawless Sabrina, was a performer, writer, producer, and mentor to LGBTQ community members. As Sabrina, Doroshow was a well-known drag queen, making appearances in New York City area clubs, and organizing and hosting drag queen pageants during the 1960s. Sabrina built on her success in the entertainment industry after her involvement in the 1968 film <emph render="italic">The Queen</emph> which documented her 1967 Miss All-America Camp Beauty Contest. The Jack Doroshow / Flawless Sabrina Papers consist of materials created and collected by Doroshow related to his career and personal life. The bulk of the materials in this collection document Doroshow's successes and failures in the entertainment industry, including files on the movie <emph render="italic">The Queen</emph>; an unrealized 1980s television show <emph render="italic">The Apple Pie Show </emph> with John Waters and Divine; and also proposals and scripts on a variety of other movie, television, and theatrical projects Doroshow attempted throughout the 1970s to the 2000s. The collection also consists of material on the drag community in New York City during the 1960s through 2010s, with some focusing specifically on Flawless Sabrina's drag career through photographs, event invitations, and show cue cards. Materials on the drag community include invitations, publications,  and photographs. This collection has numerous issues of the weekly publication <emph render="italic">Michael's Thing</emph> which connected the gay community with restaurants, gay-friendly businesses, and promotional information on special events, drag shows, and dance clubs in New York City during the 1970s and 1980s. Doroshow's papers also include files on his business ventures including his antique selling, children's quilts, music production, and magazine publication. A large collection of notebooks and notepads document his thoughts, writing ideas, and partial journal entries. Doroshow's personal files include correspondence, photographs, appointment books, and resumes.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Jack Doroshow (1939-2017), also known as the drag queen Flawless Sabrina, was a performer, writer, producer, and mentor to LGBTQ community members. In 1959 Doroshow along with two friends staged a drag pageant in Philadelphia, which eventually led to the creation of his persona Flawless Sabrina, who served as pageant hostess. He eventually formed his own company, Nationals Academy, to tap into the drag show subculture through pageants in large and small American cities. His most famous pageant was the 1967 Miss All-America Camp Beauty Contest of which the footage was made into a 1968 documentary <emph render="italic">The Queen</emph> by Frank Simon. Sabrina acted as mistress of ceremonies and film narrator. The success of the documentary resulted in an increase in speaking engagements and television appearances. Doroshow also sold antiques, as well as produced projects in film, television, and theater. He was well-known as Mother Sabrina, a mentor to not only drag performers, but other members of the LGBTQ community. He passed away in 2017.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Doroshow's pronouns within the archival description will reflect whatever name is being used for that project. For items in which he is described as Jack Doroshow (writings, correspondence) the archivist uses "he/his" pronouns, and when Flawless Sabrina material is mentioned, the pronouns are "she/hers". Usage of the subject headings drag queens and female impersonators within the finding aid reflects the way Flawless Sabrina would refer to herself.
<lb/>
<lb/>
At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in archival boxes, with loose materials foldered in their original order. Born-digital items were identified, physically separated, and inventoried, but not forensically imaged, analyzed, or described. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
In 2023, twenty-four optical discs were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged. New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content. Material was placed in acid-free folders and boxes. Overstuffed folders were separated and placed in multiple folders when needed. Material from approximately 15 framed items were unframed and foldered appropriately. Oversized material was unfolded and placed in appropriately sized boxes. Rolled cue cards from shows were sent to the Preservation Lab for housing. Two scrapbooks were rehoused by the Preservation lab as well. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
A large portion of the commercial audiovisual recordings as well as books and publications were removed from the collection. Their titles and dates were added into a spreadsheet to be stored in the collection's curatorial folder.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Jack Doroshow/Flawless Sabrina Papers consist of paper and electronic files created and collected by Jack Doroshow documenting his personal life and career as Flawless Sabrina the drag queen, actor, writer, and producer. This collection provides insight into the work and life of a drag entertainer and business person in New York during the 1960s through 2010s, including his exploration into a variety of business and entertainment ventures, his struggles financially supporting himself as an artist, and his relationships with artists and performers. This collection also documents the evolution of the drag community through the years within New York City.  
<lb/>
<lb/>
Doroshow's various projects within the music, television, theatrical, and film industries include the 1968 documentary film <emph render="italic">The Queen</emph>; an unrealized talkshow, The Apple Pie Show, with John Waters and Divine; and the movie <emph render="italic">More, More, More</emph>. Project files in this collection typically include proposal packets, scripts, budgets, and correspondence. Documentation on Jack's career as Flawless Sabrina and also the drag queen community in general is represented through photographs, event promotional material, set plans,  notes, and cue cards. Large photograph collages once mounted on Doroshow's apartment walls contain images of Doroshow with friends and partners at home and events throughout his life. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
This collection contains a notable amount of issues dating from 1973 to 1984 of <emph render="italic">Michael's Thing</emph>, a guide to information and entertainment for the LGBTQ community within the New York City area. This weekly publication provided articles, interviews, and advertisements which focused on the interests of the community including drag shows, dance clubs, and special events. These issues not only document popular events and places during this time, but Doroshow was also a contributing writer. A large number of loose notes, notepads, and notebooks date from the 1970s to the 2010s, containing Dorowshow's ideas, thoughts, production notes, to do lists, quotes, brief journal entries, and sketches. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
While working on his various entertainment industry projects, Doroshow supported himself through successful and unsuccessful business ventures including selling antiques, children's quilts, and two unrealized magazines, <emph render="italic">Reflections</emph> and <emph render="italic">Casino</emph>. His struggles to financially support himself and maintain his rent-controlled apartment in New York are well-documented in this collection, especially as he grew elderly, relying on his community to assist him. Doroshow's role as a mentor to the LGBTQ community is evident in his correspondence and notes with performers and friends, as well as appearances where he would share his experiences with others. This collection also contains material on his personal life, including resumes, and family photographs, as well as material he accumulated on partners and various people in his life.</p>  </scopecontent>

This subseries includes business cards, agreements with potential investors, press releases, shot lists, production schedules, budgets, and correspondence with John Waters and Divine, all related to the development of the show. Color sketches of caricatures of Divine in various costumes, set design images, logo mock-ups, and original painted story boards are also in this subseries. Proposal packets include letters of support, narratives describing the premise of the show, storyboards, budgets, and press releases which were distributed to potential investors and stakeholders. Also included in this subseries is Doroshow's handwritten preparatory script for his phone call with John Waters, as well as an audio recording of the conversation, along with a typed transcript.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_0a8293fb328dac62ed4be310e3508e12"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This subseries is arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_63e9abda6e161083fae83da52366eb8c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Treatment for Show and Related Memo</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1983/1983">1983</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Flawless Sabrina material includes appearance photographs, invitations, and announcements. The series also contains show planning material including production notes, stage directions, and large rolls of dialogue cue sheets for skits. </p><p>Digital and print photographs in this series include Flawless Sabrina with friends, drag queens, at events, and professional portraits of Sabrina by Diane Arbus, Julia Nuson, Ves Pitts, and Sabrina's partner, Curtis Carman. Large photograph collages previously mounted on Sabrina's apartment walls are in this series, featuring images of Sabrina, friends, events, other performers, dating from the 1980s to the 2010s. This series also has a number of artists' drawings and paintings of Flawless Sabrina, while other artists were inspired to include her in a number of video and photographic installations. This series contains video recordings, catalogs, and photographs of some of these art installations including <emph render="italic">Dorian, a Cinematic Perfume</emph>; <emph render="italic">Jack and Debra</emph> which includes footage of Flawless Sabrina juxtaposed with scenes from a Miss America Pageant; and <emph render="italic">Irma Vep, The Last Breath</emph> by Michelle Handelman. An event announcement and video recording of the 2014 NYU Tisch School lecture event featuring Flawless Sabrina sharing her experiences as a drag queen is in this series as well as video footage of her 74th birthday party in 2013 at the Soho Grand. Objects in the series include sequin pants with "Flawless" stamped on the side, and a rubber stamp with "Mother Approved, XO" in reference to Sabrina's other name, Mother Flawless Sabrina.</p><p>This series also contains material accumulated by Flawless Sabrina on drag performers and the community including books; press clippings; publications; city event guides; event invitations; wig catalogs; headshots and bios of performers. Of note is a 1960s photograph album containing performers in drag shows, but also men dressed in casual women's clothes at leisure in various private homes. This series also includes video footage from the 1970s of vacationers on Fire Island and in Central Park in New York, and a 2011 Joe Jeffreys recording of the 46th Annual Miss Fire Island Contest.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_46ca3a79bb85c7c82efaa87ed0a04ab7"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This subseries is arranged chronologically, within groupings of files.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_4173e7799f4f25a84ec7ea05c82117af" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photographs -- Shows, Pageants, Home Parties, and Informal Gatherings with Flawless Sabrina, Performers, and Others</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/1964" type="inclusive">1960-1964</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Other less successful businesses include plans and correspondence for a club in the Chrysler Building in 1987, and correspondence and advertisements for the sale of children's puppet quilts in 1983. Doroshow also attempted to start two magazines, <emph render="italic">Reflections</emph> and <emph render="italic">Casina</emph>. Files on these two publishing ventures include proposal packets, correspondence, and mock-up issues.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ece87e6ba9ad8a536dee6d43e01374b0"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This subseries is arranged chronologically, within groupings of files.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_c2f283ab2a1c978bbdf143fe72ad7d70" level="file"><did><unittitle>Antique and Artwork Consignment Business</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1965/2003" type="inclusive">1965-2003</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Family photographs from the 1930s to the 1960s contain early images of Jack, his parents, siblings, and extended family. Of note in this series are photographic portraits by Nina Meledandri of Jack and his partner from 1985, as well as candid print and digital images from parties and gatherings at his apartment from the 1980s to the 2010s. Resumes, address books, appointment books, and correspondence provide a view into the daily life of Doroshow and his activities. This series also contains ephemera Doroshow accumulated over the years on friends and partners throughout his life including Bill Wagner, Curtis Carman, Rami Shamir, and granddaughter Zachary Drucker.
Doroshow's struggle to retain his rent-stabilized apartment for over 30 years is documented in this series, illustrating the financial struggles of an aging performer in New York City during the 1980s to the 2000s. These files include correspondence with apartment management; photographic documentation of the building management's neglect of the apartment; Doroshow's requests to agencies for rent assistance; and his disbutes with utility companies. This series also contains material related to his legacy as a mentor to the LGBTQ community and drag performers which is evident in his personal correspondence which is full of notes and well-wishes; photographs from 2017 of his last birthday party; documentation of the establishment of the Flawless Sabrina Archives by his friends; and a program from his 2018 memorial service.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_a2f9457a92e9e6dd755cef45d7383828"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This subseries is arranged chronologically, within groupings of files.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_2c6611c227270a00cac68d134cbbe5c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photographs -- Jack Doroshow and Family Members</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1937/1950" type="inclusive">1937, 1948-1950, undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
