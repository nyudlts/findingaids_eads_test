<p>Series are primarily arranged chronologically, except where to do so would destroy the original order of the material; where the original folders contained material from a range of years, those folders are ordered by their earliest date, so "1997-2000," for example, comes before "1998-1999." In the case of Straub's manuscripts and typescripts, material was grouped by work and arranged chronologically within each group. Typescripts by other writers are organized alphabetically by the authors' last names to facilitate retrieval (there was no discernible original order). When folders are undated, they are grouped alphabetically and filed at the end of their respective series. When a box contains more than one series, the folder range for each series is given. Series XV has not been arranged by an archivist; the materials appear in the order they were recieved and are closed to researchers until the materials are reviewed and formerly processed by an archivist. </p><p>This collection is described primarily at the box level, and is arranged into 16 series:</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Peter Francis Straub (b. March 2, 1943, Milwaukee, Wisconson) is an author noted for his novels and short stories in the horror genre for which he has won the Bram Stoker Award, the World Fantasy Award, and the International Horror Guild Award. He received a B.A. in English from University of Wisconson-Madison in 1965 and an M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1967.</p><p>While working on a Ph.D. (ultimately abandoned) in Dublin, Ireland, Straub completed his first novel, <emph render="italic">Marriages</emph>, published in 1973. Having moved to London, Straub's work began to shift toward the horror genre, after his agent suggested he write a gothic novel. The novels <emph render="italic">Julia</emph> and <emph render="italic">If You Could See Me Now</emph> followed in 1975 and 1977. But it was the following novel, <emph render="italic">Ghost Story</emph> (1979), that jumpstarted his career as one of the foremost authors in the genre. In 1981, <emph render="italic">Ghost Story</emph> was adapted for a film starring Fred Astaire. </p><p>Straub's success in the horror genre led to the beginning of a collaborative relationship with Stephen King. Together, they have written two novels, <emph render="italic">The Talisman</emph> and <emph render="italic">Black House</emph>.</p><p>Peter Straub and his wife, Susan Straub née Bitker, married in 1966. Susan is the creator and director of Read to Me, a program that promotes and supports young mothers reading to their babies. They have two children, Ben and Emma.</p><p><emph render="bold">Novels</emph><lb/>

<p>Decisions concerning arrangement and description, as well as physical interventions taken on the collection prior to 2016 have not yet been recorded. At the time of accessioning materials from the 2016 accretions items were rehoused in acid free folders and boxes. Items were consolidated to save space. Letters and documents still in envelopes were removed from their envelopes, unfolded and laid flat in a folder with the corresponding evelope placed on top of the letter. Any instances where multiple parts were housed in one folder (and separated by paper clips or binder clips) were rehoused in separate folders to maintain order and the folders were labeled with the same title. An oversized set of posters were separated from the original order and rehoused in an oversized folder. </p><p>Materials in boxes 75-77 were removed from accession 2006.185 when the collection was initially processed and treated for possible mold damage in 2012. In 2018 the materials were placed in new, acid-free folders and boxes and integrated into Series VI, Subseries A. In 2022 an accretion was rehoused in archival boxes and folders, and inventoried on the box-level. 1 optical disc was identified to be blank and discarded from the collection.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Peter Straub Papers document Peter Straub's long career as a horror novelist and highlight his relationship with friend and colleague, Stephen King. This collection primarily contains manuscripts and typescripts of Straub's published works, fragments of unpublished works, essays, lectures, and introductions for other authors' works; hand written, typed, and e-mail correspondence including letters from Stephen and Tabitha King; periodicals that include articles about Straub and essays and short stories that he published; and contractual documentation for donations to New York University's Fales Library and Special Collections and for Straub's 2006 appearance on his favorite daytime television series, "One Life to Live." Personal materials include Struab's diaries, notebooks, school records, and day planners. The collection also includes clippings about Straub and reviews of his work; programs for conventions and conferences that he attended, where he was often a speaker or feature author; adaptations of Straub's work for television, audio, and film; and numerous annotated manuscripts by authors who asked Straub to review their work, including Stephen King and Neil Gaimen. Works by Stephen King of Note are "The Dark Tower Series," "Misery," and "Tommyknockers." Materials also include computer programs on 3.5 inch floppy disks that Straub used including Norton Rescue Disc, AST Research, Inc., The Norton Desktop for Windows, Dos 6-22, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Microsoft Intellipoint Professional, and a Kodak Picture CD. There are various audio recordings of speeches given by political figures such as Winston Churchill and programs featuring interviews with Straub, that were recorded on reel to reel magnetic tape, audiocassettes, compact discs, and photographic records. There is one videocassette featuring the show, "Prisoners of Gravity," a Canadian news program from the early 1990's that explored themes in speculative fiction.</p>  </scopecontent>
