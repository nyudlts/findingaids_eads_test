    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Frank Moore (1953-2002) is best known for his hyperrealist symbolic paintings that address junctures between social, environmental, medical, and scientific issues. Through painting Moore explored the dissonance between the medical benefits of genetic engineering and the ecological costs. He combined these themes with a painting style that favored bright colors and magical realism. In addition, Moore created intricate frames to complement the paintings. For example, the Niagara paintings have frames of piping and spigots referencing the re-routing of the water to a hydroelectric power plant as well as human consumption of polluted water. These characteristics lead The New York Times to describe Frank Moore as "a painter and AIDS activist whose jewel-like allegories brought beauty and bite to the themes of scientific progress, environmental pollution and the medical establishment."</p><p>Frank Moore was born on June 22, 1953 in New York City. He grew up on Long Island and in the Adirondacks, his childhood summer home. In 1970, at the age of 17 he attended the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Maine. In 1975 he graduated from Yale University with honors and a degree in art and psychology. After college he moved to New York City, where he studied decorative art materials and techniques while working at the Isabel O'Neil School of the Painted Finish. In 1977 he received a two-year residency at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris, France. When he returned to New York in 1979 he began designing sets and costumes for the choreographer Jim Self. Their collaboration lasted until the late 1980's and included several dance-based experimental films such as "Beehive", which won a Bessie in 1985. Moore created set designs and costumes for numerous theatrical and dance companies and performances including the Joffrey Ballet. Through these films and performances Moore explored themes of jealousy, passion and the supernatural in combination with his fascination with nature and the environment.</p><p>Moore's first one-person exhibition was in 1983 at The Clocktower in Tribeca. In 1992, Moore was selected to be represented by Sperone Westwater, a prominent NYC gallery. In 1995 his work was selected to be exhibited in the Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial. Moore's work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Albright Knox Art Gallery and the New York Public Library. Moore was also the recipient of numerous awards and grants including the National Endowment for the Arts, New York State Council on the Arts, the Jerome Foundation, and Art Matters. In 1999 he received the Academy Award in Art from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Moore continues to be represented by the Sperone Westwater Gallery in New York.</p><p>Moore was a key player in several AIDS organizations and art related projects including Visual AIDS, the artists' faction of ACT UP. While working with the group in 1991, Moore played a significant role in creating the AIDS red ribbon. The accessory helped raise a great deal of public awareness about AIDS and a great deal of money to fight AIDS as well as inspiring similar ribbons in other colors for other causes. Moore was also instrumental in the development of the Estate Project which works to document and preserve works created by people with AIDS in all artistic disciplines.</p><p>Prior to his death in April 2002, Frank Moore established the Gesso Foundation (www.gesso.org). Through this organization Moore ensured that his artwork continues to impact discourse on the environment and social issues. His life and his vision are contained within the organization's mission statement, "Frank Moore established the Gesso Foundation to place his art for maximum public benefit, and to support organizations concerned with the arts, social justice, environmental and AIDS-related causes."</p>    <list type="ordered">
