    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Nelson Sullivan (1948-1989) was a video artist who documented downtown New York City in the 1980s. Originally from South Carolina, Sullivan moved to Manhattan in the 1970s and began filming the city's art world and gay scene. He captured John Sex, Sylvia Miles, RuPaul, and other performers at downtown bars and nightclubs including Danceteria, the Limelight, Palladium, and the Pyramid Club. Sullivan also chronicled house parties at his apartment at 5 Ninth Avenue in the Meatpacking District, gallery openings, park and street festivals, conversations with taxi drivers, and the ruminations of his friends including fashion designer Alexis Del Lago and journalist Michael Musto on film. He recorded almost 2,000 hours of tape, at first using a VHS-loading camera and later an 8mm video camera. Sullivan's filmmaking is recognizable for its point of view transitions and its stream-of-consciousness narration. He also often pointed a wide-angle lens at his own face while filming to record his commentary on the people, performances, or events that he captured. Sullivan made films up until his death from a heart attack on July 4, 1989.</p><p><emph render="bold">Sources:</emph></p><p>A Very Short Introduction to Nelson Sullivan (http://merepseudbloged.wordpress.com/2010/02/20/a-very-short-introduction-to-nelson-sullivan/)</p><p>The 5 Ninth Avenue Project (http://www.youtube.com/user/5ninthavenueproject/about)</p><p>John Sanchez Interview with Dick Richards about Nelson Sullivan (http://www.bettyjack.com/funtone/nelson/johnwithdick/)</p>  </bioghist>

His friend then gives him a tour on a drive through Atlanta on their way to lunch at Burton's Grill. The tour continues before they return to the house where Larry Tee and others have gathered to watch some recorded performances. Larry Tee then takes Nelson on a drive to what will become Larry Tee's Celebrity Club for a tour, which is still under construction.
