    <abstract id="aspace_7451e8cf82fc4b0145c60a6dea6a1184">The time period covered by this collection was the final century of 400 years of Spanish colonization of the island of Cuba. Although Spain and Great Britain agreed to end the trade of enslaved people in Spanish colonies by 1820, an estimated one million enslaved Africans were brought to Cuba by Spanish colonists. Cuba formally ended its participation in the Transatlantic Slave Trade in 1867, and abolished the legal enslavement of people in 1886. Enslaved people endured family separation, harsh manual labor on sugar plantations and in sugar mills, and labor within an enslaver's household. Enslaved women were often victims of sexual assault and exploitation. From 1847-1874, hundreds of thousands of Chinese men were trafficked to Cuba as indentured laborers by the Spanish, French, British, and Americans. This collection consists of documents concerning slavery in Spanish-colonized Cuba between 1809 and 1898, and the infrastructure that supported Spanish and American planation owners at the expense of enslaved and indentured individuals. Materials include telegrams, contracts, identification papers, travel licenses, birth notices, marriage and baptism records, death and burial certificates, purchase and insurance documents, and manumission records documenting various aspects of enslavement in Cuba, including the economics of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, demographics of Cuban populations, England's abolition of slavery, the transportation of indentured Chinese laborers to Cuba, family relationships in the context of slavery, living and working conditions on sugar cane plantations, and manumission processes.</abstract>

<p>Documents with brittle paper were rehoused to prevent immediate loss and documents with ink damage were housed in mylar with paper backing for additional support. Materials were described on the collection-level. The folder-level inventory was created by the collection's seller and modified by an archivist to remove derogatory terms and contextual details not relevant to the items.</p><p>In August 2022, narrative description and individual folder titles were edited to employ the recommendations in P. Gabrielle Foreman's community-sourced document "Writing About Slavery/Teaching About Slavery: This Might Help," as well as the Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia's Anti-Racist Description Resources. These item-level titles and descriptions were written by non-Spanish language speakers who are not experts in the history of enslavement in Spanish-colonized Cuba. Some spellings are approximate. Future changes to correct inaccuracies or inappropriate language are anticipated.</p><p>Researchers can access previous versions of the finding aid in our GitHub repository at https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads/commits/master/fales/mss_569.xml.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The time period covered by this collection was the final century of 400 years of Spanish colonization of the island of Cuba. Although Spain and Great Britain agreed to end the trade of enslaved people in Spanish colonies by 1820, an estimated one million enslaved Africans were brought to Cuba by Spanish colonists. Cuba formally ended its participation in the Transatlantic Slave Trade in 1867, and abolished the legal enslavement of people in 1886. Enslaved people endured family separation, harsh manual labor on sugar plantations and in sugar mills, and labor within an enslaver's household. Enslaved women were often victims of sexual assault and exploitation. 
From 1847-1874, hundreds of thousands of Chinese men were trafficked to Cuba as indentured laborers by the Spanish, French, British, and Americans. In port cities like Hong Kong and Macao, Chinese men were kidnapped or coerced into signing contracts by enslavers posing as recruitment agents. Although the contracts offered freedom after eight years, this freedom was not enforced, and the laborers often died before the term ended due to malnourishment and abusive conditions.</p>  </bioghist>

Valdés lost the Battle of Artaza (April 22, 1835). Valdés signed the Lord Eliot Convention soon after, regulating the treatment of prisoners during that war.
