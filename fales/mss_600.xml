Crimp taught contemporary art, art theory, dance theory, feminist theory, gay theory, and queer theory at many institutions. Crimp's work as a critic focused on postmodern art theory, and combined activism, editing, writing, and exhibition curation. His AIDS activism involved personal participation in the group ACT UP, centering AIDS in scholarly journals, and original cultural analysis that contributed to the development of queer theory.

The Douglas Crimp Papers (dated 1970-2019) consist of materials created and collected by Crimp documenting his life, AIDS activism, and career as an art critic, curator, and teacher in the fields of dance, film, photography, feminist theory, and queer theory. The bulk of the collection includes correspondence, scholarly articles, drafts of lectures on critical theory topics, manuscripts and drafts for published books, and notes and drafts for seminars and lectures.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Douglas Crimp (1944-2019) was an art historian, critic, curator, teacher, photographer, and AIDS activist. Crimp was born in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and studied art history at Tulane University in New Orleans. He moved to New York City in 1967, after which he worked as a curatorial assistant at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and as an art critic for <emph render='italic'>Art News</emph> and <emph render='italic'>Art International</emph>. Crimp taught contemporary art, art theory, dance theory, feminist theory, gay theory, and queer theory at many institutions, including The School of Visual Arts, Sarah Lawrence College, and the University of Rochester.</p><p>Crimp's work as a critic focused on postmodern art theory, and combined activism, editing, writing, and exhibition curation. His AIDS activism involved personal participation in the group ACT UP, centering AIDS in scholarly journals, and original cultural analysis that contributed to the development of queer theory. He published multiple works, including <emph render='italic'>AIDS Demo Graphics</emph>, <emph render='italic'>On the Museum's Ruin</emph>, and <emph render='italic'>Before Pictures</emph>, his memoir. Crimp also curated many exhibitions and wrote the corresponding catalogues, most notably, <emph render='italic'>Pictures</emph> at Artists Space (1977), which helped launch the careers of artists including Sherrie Levine and Robert Longo, among others. Crimp coined the term "Pictures Generation" to define the work of artists like Longo and Levine, who appropriated images from mass culture to carry out a subversive critique. While editor of the contemporary arts journal <emph render='italic'>October</emph>, he wrote articles that upended the idea of the museum as an objective space for presenting artwork. His work influenced a generation of artists, such as Cindy Sherman and Joan Jonas, by exploring the idea that a work of art is dependent on its historical and social circumstances and encouraging artists to be disruptive and revolutionary. </p><p>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Douglas Crimp Papers (dated 1911-2019) consist of materials created and collected by Crimp documenting his life, AIDS activism, and career as an art critic, curator, and teacher in the fields of dance, film, photography, feminist theory, and queer theory. His advocacy of revolutionary advances in performance art, video, photography, painting, and sculpture is apparent in his early writing and curatorial work on such artists as Agnes Martin, Joan Jonas, Cindy Sherman, and Richard Serra, all of whom were seen as artists who were experimenting with traditional methods. Additionally, he challenged the traditional idea of a museum, which he did not see as open to experimentation; this view is evident in his collaboration with Louise Lawler for <emph render='italic'>On the Museum's Ruins</emph>. When the AIDS crisis emerged in the mid-1980s, Crimp fought for the rights and visibility of people living with H.I.V.; his activism is not only reflected in his participation in different advocacy groups such as ACT UP but in his writing as well. He focused on queer theory in the 1987 special issue of <emph render='italic'>October</emph> titled "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism" (included in this collection in the publication, <emph render='italic'>AIDS Riot: Artist Collectives Against AIDS, New York, 1987-1994</emph>) and "Getting the Warhol We Deserve: Cultural Studies and Queer Culture" (1999), about Andy Warhol, among other articles and books.</p><p>The bulk of the collection documents Crimp's career as an art critic, curator, and teacher, and includes correspondence, scholarly articles, drafts of lectures on critical theory topics, gallery invitations and announcements, and notes and drafts for seminars and lectures. Crimp's work as an editor, critic, and writer are particularly well represented through correspondence with publishers, contracts and other agreements, manuscript drafts (in both paper and digital formats), research materials, press releases, and reviews.  Crimp's curatorial work is documented through loan agreements and documents used to plan exhibitions at various galleries. This collection also includes personal materials, such as weekly calendar planners from the late 1970s through the 2000s, personal correspondence, ACT UP t-shirts, and photographs (some of which are in digital formats).</p>  </scopecontent>

Crimp was a founding member of Sex Panic!, which was organized to oppose both mainstream political measures to control sex, and elements within the gay community who advocated same-sex marriage and the restriction of public sexual culture as solutions to the HIV crisis. The group's activities included some conventional events, such as teach-ins, summits, and lectures, and some unconventional events, such as demonstrating alongside ACT UP against the plan by the Gay Men's Health Crisis to identify seropositive patients by name in public HIV status reporting, rather than the anonymized reporting the group favored. Materials related to this group contain correspondence, flyers, editorials, memos, notes, and publicity statements. Additionally, there are various t-shirts from Crimp's participation with the group ACT UP, or AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, which is an international, grassroots political group working to end the AIDS pandemic. His participation in various marches and rallies with ACT UP is evident in the Photographs subseries.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_194467edb37b45da1c1a9913fd0924ea" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sex Panic!</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1997/1998" type="inclusive">1997-1998</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_21237eb6e3e5832aefa8e436b12946fb" label="Mixed Materials [31142063352432]" type="Box">7</container><container id="aspace_ff078bfd101708a5f4ab9af3b7c9b024" parent="aspace_21237eb6e3e5832aefa8e436b12946fb" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_003691dab86e6fe6eb34cf19005e207d" level="file"><did><unittitle>ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) T-Shirts</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/1999" type="inclusive">circa 1990-1999</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_26c696a4fb283b650b5d2c77d39a818b" label="Mixed Materials [31142063352457]" type="Box">33</container></did></c></c></c><c id="aspace_bf331fbaeaae476ff1f1f85255831157" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series II.

This focus can be seen in the exhibitions <emph render='italic'>Agnes Martin</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Pictures</emph>, and <emph render='italic'>Dia's Andy: Through the Lens of Patronage</emph> respectively. Materials consist of correspondence, memos, exhibition catalogues and annoucements, press releases, lists of artists' work, photographs of artwork, loan forms, wall text, and contracts with institutions sponsoring the exhibitions. Two exhibitions that Crimp did not curate are included here, <emph render='italic'>The Pictures Generation</emph> and <emph render='italic'>Pictures: Before and After</emph>, because they were inspired by Crimp's exhibition, <emph render='italic'>Pictures</emph>, and reflect his influence on the art world. Additionally, some of his personal artwork was used in the exhibitions and the latter exhibition was dedicated to him. He most likely also acted as a consultant for both exhibitions. A few materials are in Spanish.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_620f019aa8822ca8ae2bd3155307eb33"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Consulting work is arranged first, followed by curatorial work, which is arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_d3abbda9316dce9cf37d50442534a6e7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Consulting for Lauren Holly and Jim Carrey</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1997/1997">1997</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

His early advocacy of art that subverted the norm is evident in his articles on Agnes Martin (1973) and Joan Jonas (1976). His idea that museums are not neutral institutions is reflected in his book collaboration with Louise Lawler, <emph render='italic'>On the Museum's Ruins</emph>. Crimp's advancment of queer theory can be seen in "Portraits of People with AIDS" (1992) and <emph render='italic'>Before Pictures</emph>, which describes his own experiences growing up gay in Idaho in the 1950s.

Most of these materials were collected and consulted by Crimp as research for his writing and curatorial work on the artists of the "Pictures Generation," such as Sherrie Levine, Jack Goldstein, and Cindy Sherman; dance and performance artists, such as Yvonne Rainer; and AIDS activism and queer theory, as viewed in the writing of Michael Callen and Juan A. Suárez. Additionally, some material was sent to Crimp by friends, colleagues, and publishers for review or comment, as evident in inscribed works by Richard Meyer and Eve Kosofsky Sedwick. Some materials are in languages other than English. Many of the authors and artists listed here can also be found in Series VIII.

Additional topics include other art exhibitons to which he was invited, as seen in the poster, brochures, and postcards in the Art Exhibitions folder, and writing about contemporary art, as viewed in issues of <emph render='italic'>Parachute</emph> and <emph render='italic'>Newspaper Jan Mot</emph> in the Art Magazines folder.
